# The 22 Shrutis and Prime Numbers

**Context:** On the mathematical structure of Indian classical music

When you ask, "Can we perform Kriya Yoga by uttering sounds or listening to sounds?" I'm using the word sound and not music because music is just a certain arrangement of sounds. The notes are not changing in the music, it's only the arrangement of notes which are constantly being played with, with various permutations and combinations.

Twenty-two shrutis—the word shruti means a micro-note. Of the seven notes that normally we know of, which are related to the seven colors and the seven chakras within the system, the twenty-two shrutis are micro-notes—between notes there are notes.

The numbers that make up the ratios on the string are multiples of the prime numbers: one, two, three and five. This also represents the four elements, leaving out the space.

These twenty-two shrutis, these unifying prime numbers, form a pattern—it's a citadel by itself. When an Indian classical musician is performing, they are not singing set pieces. They start off with a raga, which is a certain basic pattern. Over that, depending upon the skill of an individual musician, he builds a whole citadel, and this citadel has a mathematical basis.

We know today, as per modern science, every structure, everything in the universe can be reduced to a mathematical structure; that is the backbone, or the blueprint of the existence.

The reason why people go into different states of experience—you will see Indian classical music being played, people are counting numbers on their fingers, trying to understand the structure that's being built. It is not only the aesthetic of it, it is the mathematic of it, it is the existential structures that are being built. By using music in a specific way, you can change the very structure of who you are.

**Key Numbers:** 22, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- 22 shrutis (micro-tones) between 7 notes
- Ratios based on primes: 1, 2, 3, 5
- These 4 primes represent 4 elements (excluding space/akash)
- 7 notes ↔ 7 chakras ↔ 7 colors
- Music as mathematical structure-building
