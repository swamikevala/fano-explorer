# The Four Types of Agni (Fire)

Though among the five elements, fire accounts for the smallest proportion in the composition of the human body (4%), its influence is tremendous. In many ways, fire represents life. One major indicator for whether you are alive or dead is if the fire is still on in you, or if your body has gone cold.

There are four forms of fire that burn within us:

## 1. Jatharagni (Digestive Fire)
Jathara means stomach or digestive process. Without a little bit of fire in your belly, you cannot digest the food that you eat. Food is functioning as fuel that you need to break down in order to release the energy. If the digestive fire is well-nourished and well-supplied with fuel, it also becomes reproductive fire. Both digestion and reproduction depend on jatharagni.

## 2. Chitagni (Fire of Intelligence)
Chitta is a dimension of intelligence within you that transcends the limitations of the physical form. The fire of intelligence can manifest on many different levels, the first level of manifestation being the intellect. If your chitagni is not reasonably fired, your intellect will become weak and ineffective. However, if your chitagni is fired up, it will manifest itself in the form of intellect. If your chitagni is burning bright, you will lose interest in food, sexuality, and other matters of the body.

## 3. Bhutagni (Elemental Fire)
If your elemental fire is on, the circus of the body and mind will not make much sense to you. Your interest and focus will shift from the antics of the body and mind to a more fundamental aspect of creation – the source of life. If you take charge of your bhutagni, you will have fundamental mastery over the process of life.

## 4. Sarvagni (Universal Fire)
Beyond this, there is sarvagni. According to modern science, the physical dimension of existence is less than five percent. That means if you know the entire physical dimension of the universe, you know only five percent of existence. Sarvagni touches the dimension where there are no elements, where there is no creation as you know it—where there is no physical nature. Generally, a Yogi who wants to access the nature of life will focus only on sarvagni, because this is the ultimate fire – but it is a cool fire.

**Key Numbers:** 4 (types of fire), 4% (fire in body), 5% (physical universe)  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- 4 types of agni correspond to 4 levels of mastery
- Fire is only 4% of body yet most transformative
- Physical creation is <5% of cosmos (less than 1% in yogic system)
- Progression: Jathara → Chita → Bhuta → Sarva (body → mind → elements → beyond)
