# The 84 Pranas and Pancha Pranas

We are in a womb of prana, which is the atmospheric bubble. This larger prana breaks down into eighty-four pranas. Out of these, five pranas can cover the day-to-day requirements of most human beings. These pancha pranas are sufficient to keep your body and mind well, and yourself spiritually alive.

Another ten are needed for someone who is into occult practices. The remaining pranas are generally too subtle to explore and experience.

The prana vayu is an inward movement between the pit of the throat and the navel. At least sixty percent of the process of Shakti Chalana Kriya is aimed towards prana vayu.

The area between the navel and the pit of the throat is the main activity zone of prana. When you eat bad food and have gas, you will experience a great lack of energy in the system, because the prana vayu will not function well. You have gotten the air in the wrong place. It should move between the navel and the pit of the throat – in this area, it is powerful.

If the prana vayu moves below the navel, the effervescence in life is gone. The body feels like a sack of potatoes.

The standard is that generally, if you do 1,008 days of Shakti Chalana Kriya without a break, then your prana reaches a certain level of activity. The sheer energy that you carry will set you apart.

**Key Numbers:** 84, 5, 10, 1008, 60%  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- 84 total pranas in the system
- 5 (pancha pranas) sufficient for ordinary life
- 10 additional for occult practices (5 + 10 = 15)
- 1008 days of practice = mastery (1008 = 84 × 12 = moons in 84 years)
- 60% of Shakti Chalana focused on prana vayu
- Remaining 84 - 15 = 69 pranas are too subtle
