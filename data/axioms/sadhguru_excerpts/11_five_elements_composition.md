# The Five Elements: Body Composition

**Source:** Sadhguru on Pancha Bhutas  
**Context:** On the precise composition of elements in the human body

This body is made of five fundamental elements – Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. The quality of your life essentially depends on how wonderful these five elements are within you.

How well organized the five elements are in your system decides how firm and stable and organically strong this body is:

- **72%** of the body is just **Water**
- **12%** is **Earth**
- **6%** is **Air**
- **4%** is **Fire**
- **6%** is **Space** (Akash)

So it's 84% water and earth combined. Another 6% is air, which is the easiest thing to manage and take charge of because there is breath and you can take charge of it in a certain way. Another 4% is fire. Taking mastery over fire could do many things to you but because you are householders living in family situations, you do not have to take charge of fire.

The remaining 6% is space. You do not have to bother about that unless you want to explore mystical dimensions of the existence. To live well, four elements are enough. The fifth one is not relevant for people who just want to live well.

Two-thirds of the planet is water, two-thirds of the body is water. Whichever way the nature of the planet is, it is manifested in your body in many different ways.

**Key Numbers:** 72, 12, 6, 4, 6 (totaling 100%)  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- Water (72%) + Earth (12%) = 84% (solid/liquid matter)
- Air (6%) + Fire (4%) = 10% (gaseous/energetic)
- Space (6%) = etheric/mystical
- Body mirrors planet: ~72% water in both
- 84 = current cosmic cycle number (coincidence?)
