# From Infinity to Zero: The Unfolding of Creation

**Source:** SG conversation with Dr. Bernard Carr  
**Context:** On the yogic understanding of how creation unfolds

---

In the Yogic principle, the universe was like this—usually represented as an Ouroboros, a snake, a cobra with mouth and tail included and a hood rising. This is not the European Ouroboros which is a circle. This is how it was, so we call this Anant—that means infinite.

The nature of infinity: if you make infinity plus ten, it's still infinity. Infinity minus million, still infinity. Your mathematics don't work. You do plus, minus, multiply, divide—nothing. So it was this way. You could do nothing with it.

Then it unfolded and became like this—then we call this Shoonya.

What was that which is infinite? Was it not empty? We could not even call it empty or full at that time because it's infinite. There's no plus minus to it, no multiplication and division to it. It uncoiled itself to become nothing. Nothing means we must put a hyphen between no and thing. It is a no-thing, but it has a presence now.

This presence, maybe this is what modern scientists are calling dark energy or dark force. We call this Shoonya or Kala. The word Kala means empty. The word kala means darkness. The word kala means time. The word kala means space. All these four things became somewhat manifest because it became a kala.

What was infinite space became zero. Now, plus one is plus one, minus one is minus one. Suddenly, there is no physicality yet, but there is a mathematical foundation for its physicality.

**Key Numbers:** ∞ (infinity), 0 (zero), ±1  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- Infinity is beyond arithmetic operations
- Creation unfolds: ∞ → 0 (shoonya)
- Zero provides mathematical foundation for physicality
- Kala = darkness = time = space = emptiness (four meanings, one word)
- Only after zero exists can +1 and -1 have meaning
