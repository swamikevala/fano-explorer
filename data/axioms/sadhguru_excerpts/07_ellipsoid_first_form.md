# The Ellipsoid: The First Form

**Source:** SG on sound and creation  
**Context:** On how sound manifests as form

---

The whole existence is a complex web of reverberation. In this, the most fundamental sound is AUM.

If the AUM is uttered properly, the very utterance will take you towards the shape of an ellipsoid, which is seen as the first form, which is the linga in the yogic culture.

The ellipsoid is the shape which repeatedly is seen everywhere in the cosmic nature. From atomic nature to cosmic nature, ellipsoid is the basic structure, because it is the first form. And how the sound AUM manifests this form—this can be seen visually through cymatics.

The beginning and the end, and before beginning and after the end—that which is beginningless and endless—this we refer to as Shiva. But between the beginning and the end there is a whole lot of drama. This drama is a play of forms, many kinds of forms—the galaxies, the many universes, systems like our solar system in trillions, floating around—all essentially, a play of geometrical forms.

Right now you and me, all play of geometrical forms. Whether your geometry has come together in a reasonably good or perfect way, or badly synchronized geometry—you are a product of the world of forms, many types of forms. All forms have shapes. A form means invariably it belongs to the world of geometry.

**Key Numbers:** 1 (first form)  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- Ellipsoid is the first and most fundamental form
- AUM sound naturally creates ellipsoid shape
- All existence is geometrical
- From atoms to galaxies: ellipsoid recurs at all scales
- Linga = primordial ellipsoid = representation of "1"
