# Cyclical Movement and Liberation

**Source:** SG conversation with Dr. Bernard Carr  
**Context:** On the nature of physical creation and transcendence

When he breathes—that created a certain amount of energy. That we call as Shakti. When energy came out of him, this firmament of nothingness, which is a powerful force, started reverberating initially, then caused ripples, those ripples led to cyclical movements. So with these cyclical movements, the first physical forms came out and it all burst forth.

As these cycles became more and more complicated, from whatever we call as electrons, protons, atoms, planetary systems, universes—all these evolved because of cyclical movements. Fundamentally, we see physicality as a consequence of cyclical movement. Our very birth is because of the cyclical movements in our mother's bodies, otherwise we wouldn't be born.

Any cycle naturally has a centripetal force and a centrifugal force. If you get caught up in the centripetal, you get crushed. If you ride the centrifugal, then you're released, a tangent is formed.

To attain to this tangent is the goal of life in the East. We call this mukti, nirvana, moksha. Essentially we want to ride the physical cycles in such a way we are liberated from the physical cycles.

The cycles of time can crush you. Why in their childhood they were like this and now they become like that—lot of people. Time has crushed them. It's actually time which has crushed them, or the same time could trap people. They are okay but they are bored and they don't know what to do with themselves.

**Key Concepts:** Cycles, centripetal/centrifugal, tangent  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- All physical existence = cyclical movement
- Cycles contain: centripetal (inward/crushing) + centrifugal (outward/liberating)
- Liberation = catching the tangent to escape the cycle
- Time itself is cyclical and can crush or trap
- Breaking free requires moving perpendicular to the cycle
