# Shakti and Electromagnetic Force: Creation from Nothing

**Source:** SG conversation with physicist  
**Context:** On the yogic lore of creation and its parallel with quantum physics

According to the yogic lore: Shiva was asleep, that means he became totally still, absolutely. And then, Parvati or Shakti came and moved around him three times, then he stirred up. It's from them creation happened—she just went around him three times and the basic force of creation began to happen, which was not physical, which was a transition.

"We have experiments where in absolute vacuum states, if you apply electromagnetic force, suddenly virtual protons and virtual neutrons happen." It doesn't even have to touch—just around that if you apply electromagnetic force, virtual protons and virtual neutrons happen. She just goes around and creation begins.

Spontaneous creation of particles happens and they come in pairs—they're always created in pairs. Those particles when they annihilate each other, the way the energy forces work is that the electromagnetic forces around create from nothingness a pair of particles and the pair of particles when they join, they copulate, actually spontaneous fuse results in the creation of energy. This is a very well accepted scientific principle and verified in experiment.

Today it's an experimentally proved fact—if you apply any kind of electromagnetic force on a vacuum space, immediately virtual protons and virtual neutrons will happen. That is, from nothingness something-ness is created. So this is what we are talking about: Shiva is vacuum—"That which is not." If you apply electromagnetic force which we refer to as shakti, the moment shakti comes in, suddenly creation begins. This is just a dialectical expression of the same thing.

**Key Numbers:** 3, 2 (pairs)  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- Shakti circles Shiva 3 times → creation begins
- Particles always created in pairs (duality from unity)
- Vacuum + electromagnetic force → particle-antiparticle pairs
- Shiva = vacuum = 0 = "that which is not"
- Shakti = electromagnetic force = that which activates
