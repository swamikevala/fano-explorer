There are many ways to arrange these seven dimensions. There is no such thing as seven chakras. There are seven dimensions and these 112 chakras arrange themselves in these seven dimensions. Instead of going into 112 which is too much of a thing, people are just talking about seven because these are seven categories or seven dimensions.

The seven notes that normally we know of are related to the seven colors and the seven chakras within the system.

The spiral snake with seven meeting places—the commerce symbol even today uses this. That dimension is being used in so many ways. Dhyanalinga is seven chakras manifest.

For the chakras:
- Muladhara: color is red-orange, mantra is lam, element is earth
- Swadhisthana: greenish-blue in color, mantra is vam, element is water  
- Manipura: color is red, element is fire
- Anahata: which is electric blue in color, mantra is ham, element is akash
- Vishuddhi: black-orange, mantra is aum, we've run out of elements
- Ajna: represents beyond elements
- Sahasrara: colorless, no mantra, no prana, no element associated with this—this is boundless
