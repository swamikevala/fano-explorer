# The 21 Asanas and 84 Yogasanas

**Context:** On the significance of 21 and 84 in yogic practice

Why do Isha Hatha Yoga programs offer a set of 21 asanas? Before boosting the energy of the body in a big way, the system should be properly prepared.

Based on the 84 cosmic cycles, we created 84 fundamental asanas. So the yogic system says if you get into these 84 asanas, your system will be ready to access the next dimension. These 84 asanas most people will never achieve, because it needs extraordinary sadhana to get there.

Out of the 84 cosmic cycles:
- Many have dissolved. Their bare, vague footprint is there, but they have dissolved.
- **21 of them have a little larger footprint.**
- Out of these 21, ten are almost non-physical.
- The remaining eleven are somewhat mildly physical.
- But the last four are reasonably physical.

So we see this number 21 as an important process. Whatever we want to do, we do it in 21 minutes, in 21 ways.

The 84 basic Yogasanas are fundamentally designed and aimed at cleansing the deeply entrenched elemental memories in the body.

If you want to rise beyond your physicality absolutely, you have to rise beyond all the 21. But you don't have to bother about those things, because if you rise above the physical nature, not just in terms of physical body, but even the information is physical. All information that you carry, which makes you you, whether dead or alive, it still makes you, you—that one, we want to rise beyond that.

**Key Numbers:** 21, 84, 10, 11, 4  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- 84 total cosmic cycles = 84 fundamental asanas
- 21 cycles still have active footprints = 21 essential asanas
- 21 = 3 × 7 (trinity × dimensions)
- Of the 21: 10 non-physical + 11 mildly physical (10 + 11 = 21)
- Of the 11: 4 are reasonably physical (11 - 4 = 7 transitional)
- 84 = 4 × 21 (the 4 physical ones × the 21 categories)
