  "insight": "Removing the 4 \"Fire\" states (where Self=Center) from 112 leaves exactly 108, suggesting the mala's 108 beads represent the traversal of the Manifest Universe (Earth, Air, Water, Space) revolving around the 4 Unmanifest/Central Fire states which act as the hidden pivot (Meru). This derives 108 as \"112 minus the Singularity\" giving structural rather than arbitrary meaning.",
