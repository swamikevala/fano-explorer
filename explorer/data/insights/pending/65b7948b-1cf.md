> The 72 "Water/Flow" states split naturally into 36 "Attached Flows" (where field T contains the Self P₀) and 36 "Detached Flows" (where T does not contain Self). This binary structure maps isomorphically to the 72 Carnatic Melakarta Ragas divided into 36 Suddha Madhyama (M1) and 36 Prati Madhyama (M2)—suggesting the "Madhyama Shift" is a geometric toggle between Self-Inclusive and Self-Exclusive field geometries.
