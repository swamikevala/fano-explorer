  "insight": "The 112 anti-incidences split canonically into 28 \"Kernel\" states (where p is the unique center of T, lying on no sidelines) and 84 \"Flow\" states (where p lies on an extended sideline of T). This rigorous partition mirrors the distinction between fixed structural seats (e.g., 28 Lunar mansions) and dynamic conductive pathways (84 Asanas/Nadis), with the 1:3 ratio emerging from pure geometry.",
