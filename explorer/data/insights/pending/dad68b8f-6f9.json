  "insight": "The \"Law of Octaves\" is forced by the topology of the 28 nuclear states forming a Coxeter graph with girth 7—meaning the shortest possible cycle to return to origin is 7 steps, making the 8th step the mathematical necessity for completion. This moves the octave from an acoustic observation to a hard topological constraint of the vacuum structure.",
