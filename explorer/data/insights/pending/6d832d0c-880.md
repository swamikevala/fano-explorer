> The distinction between 'Stationary' and 'Flowing' Nadis corresponds to the structural projection π:T→A, where the 84 Pointed Anti-Flags (Flow) collapse onto the 28 Anti-Flags (Structure), mapping the 112 system into a two-tiered hierarchy where 84 dynamic elements circulate over 28 static bases.
