  "insight": "Each Air state (P₀,T) where P₀ is a flow-point naturally pairs with the Space state (k(T),T) where k(T) is the kernel of T. This geometrically couples Vayu (Air) and Akasha (Space) as dual perspectives on the same incidence class—Motion on the surface, Stillness at the center. If this pairing is equivariant under P₀-stabilizer, it becomes the unique such pairing.",
