  "insight": "The graph has two structurally distinct edge types - \"cluster edges\" (sharing K₄ vertex) and \"bond edges\" (sharing K₄ edge) - which must map to different musical intervals. This positions the model as a finite Tonnetz-like object with multiple interval generators, not a simple circle.",
