  "insight": "A thaat/raga skeleton can be generated combinatorially from the axis-broken orbit picture: take the two fixed notes (Sa, Pa), choose exactly one from each of the four V-type pairs, and choose exactly one from the Ma E-type pair. This yields 2^5 = 32 canonical heptatonic \"choice-frames,\" turning scale families into a forced selection rule from symmetry types.",
