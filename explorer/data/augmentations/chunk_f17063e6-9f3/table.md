| Configuration Type | Count | Points in Configuration | Relation to C | Relation to L∞ | Description |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Type 1** | 12 | {C, A, B, D} | Contains C | A, B, D not on L∞ | Heart quadrangles containing C with no other points on horizon |
| **Type 2** | 72 | {A, B, D, E} | Does not contain C | A, B, D, E not on L∞ | Earth quadrangles with all points off horizon |
| **Type 3** | 4 | {C, A, B, D} | Contains C | Exactly 1 of A, B, D on L∞ | Mixed quadrangles with C and exactly one horizon point |
| **Type 4** | 6 | {C, A, B, D} | Contains C | Exactly 2 of A, B, D on L∞ | Mixed quadrangles with C and exactly two horizon points |
| **Type 5** | 6 | {C, A, B, D} | Contains C | All 3 (A, B, D) on L∞ | Degenerate quadrangles with C and three collinear horizon points |
| **Type 6** | 12 | {A, B, D, E} | Does not contain C | Exactly 3 of A, B, D, E on L∞ | Degenerate quadrangles without C, three points collinear on horizon |
| **TOTAL** | **112** | | | | |

**Notes:** - The partition is determined entirely by two incidence predicates: whether C is in the 4-set, and how many points lie on L∞

**Verification:** 1. Total count: 12 + 72 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 12 = 112 ✓
