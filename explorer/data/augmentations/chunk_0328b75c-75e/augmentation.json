      "content": "THEOREM: In the Fano plane, there are exactly 112 ordered pairs (x,T) where x is a point, T is a triangle (set of three non-collinear points), and x ∉ T. Furthermore, each point appears as the first coordinate in exactly 16 such pairs.\n\nASSUMPTIONS:\n- The Fano plane has exactly 7 points\n- The Fano plane has exactly 7 lines\n- Each line contains exactly 3 points\n- Each pair of distinct points determines a unique line\n- Three points are collinear if and only if they lie on one of the 7 lines\n\nPROOF:\n1. First, we count the total number of 3-element subsets of the 7 points.\n   The number of ways to choose 3 points from 7 is C(7,3) = 35.\n   [By the combination formula]\n\n2. Next, we identify which 3-element subsets form lines (collinear triples).\n   Since there are exactly 7 lines and each line contains exactly 3 points,\n   there are exactly 7 collinear triples.\n   [By the assumption about lines in the Fano plane]\n\n3. Therefore, the number of triangles (non-collinear triples) is:\n   |{T : T is a triangle}| = 35 - 7 = 28\n   [By subtraction: total triples minus collinear triples]\n\n4. For any triangle T, we count how many points are not in T.\n   Since T contains exactly 3 points and the Fano plane has 7 points total,\n   the number of points not in T is 7 - 3 = 4.\n   [By subtraction]\n\n5. The total number of anti-incidence pairs (x,T) where x ∉ T is:\n   |{(x,T) : x is a point, T is a triangle, x ∉ T}| = 28 × 4 = 112\n   [By the multiplication principle: each of 28 triangles has 4 non-incident points]\n\n6. To verify each point appears in the same number of anti-incidences:\n   By the automorphism group of the Fano plane (which acts transitively on points),\n   all points are equivalent under the symmetries of the plane.\n   Therefore, each point must appear in the same number of anti-incidences.\n   [By symmetry via Aut(Fano)]\n\n7. Since there are 112 anti-incidence pairs total and 7 points,\n   each point appears in exactly 112/7 = 16 anti-incidences.\n   [By division and the pigeonhole principle with symmetry] ∎",
