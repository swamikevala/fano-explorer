      "content": "THEOREM: Let P = PG(2,2) be the Fano plane. Define T to be the set of all triangles (non-collinear triples) in P, and let A = {(x,T) : x ∈ P, T ∈ T, x ∉ T} be the set of point-triangle anti-incidences. Then |A| = 112.\n\nASSUMPTIONS:\n- P = PG(2,2) is the projective plane of order 2 with 7 points and 7 lines\n- Each line contains exactly 3 points\n- Each pair of distinct points determines a unique line\n- Each pair of distinct lines intersects in exactly one point\n- A triangle T is defined as a set of three non-collinear points\n- The automorphism group Aut(P) ≅ PSL(3,2) acts transitively on points and on triangles\n\nPROOF:\n1. **Count the triangles in P**: The total number of 3-subsets of P is C(7,3) = 35. The number of collinear triples equals the number of lines, which is 7. Therefore, |T| = 35 - 7 = 28. [By direct counting]\n\n2. **Verify each triangle contains exactly 3 points**: By definition, each triangle T ∈ T is a set of three points. [By definition of triangle]\n\n3. **Count triangles containing a fixed point**: Fix any point x ∈ P. The number of triangles containing x equals the number of non-collinear triples that include x. There are C(6,2) = 15 pairs of points distinct from x. Among these, exactly 3 pairs lie on each of the 3 lines through x, giving 9 collinear pairs. Therefore, there are 15 - 9 = 6 non-collinear pairs {y,z} with y,z ≠ x. Each such pair forms a triangle {x,y,z} with x. However, we must count more carefully:\n   - Total 2-subsets from the 6 points not equal to x: C(6,2) = 15\n   - For each of the 3 lines through x, there are 2 other points on that line, giving C(2,1)×3 = 6 pairs where both points lie on a line with x\n   - Non-collinear pairs: 15 - 6 = 9 (correction from above)\n   - But we need triples containing x: For each of the C(6,2) = 15 pairs {y,z} where y,z ≠ x, the triple {x,y,z} is a triangle iff y,z don't lie on a line with x.\n   \n4. **Apply orbit-stabilizer theorem**: Since Aut(P) acts transitively on points, all points are equivalent under the symmetry group. Let Gx be the stabilizer of point x. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, |Aut(P)| = |P| · |Gx| = 7 · |Gx|. Since |Aut(P)| = |PSL(3,2)| = 168, we have |Gx| = 24. The action of Gx on the set of triangles containing x has orbits of equal size by the transitivity of the action on triangles. Since there are 28 triangles total and the action is transitive on triangles, each point is contained in the same number of triangles. Let this number be k. Then counting point-triangle incidences two ways: 7k = 28 · 3, so k = 12.\n\n5. **Count anti-incidences for a fixed point**: For any point x ∈ P, the number of triangles not containing x is |T| - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16. [By subtraction]\n\n6. **Count total anti-incidences**: Since each point x is not in exactly 16 triangles, and there are 7 points, |A| = 7 × 16 = 112. [By multiplication principle] ∎",
