      "Priority order for augmentations:",
      "1. **DIAGRAM** - Most urgent. The geometric nature of this insight demands visual clarification",
      "especially given Claude's confusion about triangles vs lines. A clear diagram would prevent future misunderstandings.",
      "2. **CODE** - Second priority. Would provide computational verification and generate the data for other augmentations. Quick to implement and gives confidence in the numerical claims.",
      "3. **TABLE** - Third priority. While very useful as a reference",
      "it's less critical than the diagram for understanding",
      "and the code can generate it automatically.",
      "4. **PROOF** - Lowest priority. The reviewers already agree the mathematics is correct",
      "and Gemini provided a solid counting argument. A formal proof would be nice but isn't essential for this insight's validity.",
      "The diagram is particularly critical here because the insight is fundamentally geometric",
      "and the terminology around \"triangles\" vs \"lines\" needs visual grounding to avoid the definitional issues that arose in the reviews."
