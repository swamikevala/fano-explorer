> There is a canonical projection from 112 states onto the 14 Heawood macro-nodes (7 points ⊔ 7 lines) that builds a concrete weighted "nadi backbone": incidence edges appear with multiplicity 4 and non-incidence pairs with multiplicity 1, providing a precise mechanism by which "112 microchannels live on a 14-node infrastructure."
