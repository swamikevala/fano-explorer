> Removing the 4 "Fire" states (where Self=Center) from 112 leaves exactly 108, suggesting the mala's 108 beads represent the traversal of the Manifest Universe (Earth, Air, Water, Space) revolving around the 4 Unmanifest/Central Fire states which act as the hidden pivot (Meru). This derives 108 as "112 minus the Singularity" giving structural rather than arbitrary meaning.
