  "insight": "Fix a distinguished point p in the Fano plane and interpret it as the tonic anchor (Sa)—the necessary symmetry-breaking that turns a purely relational geometry into a musical system \"with a home.\" Now redefine a \"shruti\" in this model as a contextual intonation-state: a pair (svara, context) = (P, L) where P is a swara-location (a point) and L is the harmonic/relational context (a line) that contains it. With this definition, the Fano plane supplies exactly 21 shruti-states, because it has exactly 21 flags (P ∈ L). Relative to the tonic p, these 21 states decompose canonically as 21 = 12 + 6 + 3, where the 12 are the flags on the four lines not through p (a natural \"12-tone\" substructure), the 6 are the non-tonic flags on the three lines through p (approach/departure shades relative to the tonic), and the 3 are the tonic's own contextual states (p, L) for the three lines through p. Finally, adjoin one additional degenerate state ∅ (\"silence / rest / octave-closure\": the absence of pitched context), yielding 22 total states {flags} ∪ {∅}. In this way the 12-note system appears as an intrinsic 12-subset inside a larger 22-state space, and the \"extra\" microtonal degrees of freedom arise inevitably from the full flag structure rather than being bolted on.",
