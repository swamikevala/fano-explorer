  "insight": "The 112 states map exactly to the 28 vertices (Nuclear/Structure) and 84 directed edges (Tangential/Movement) of the Coxeter graph, defining the 84 \"Asanas\" not as static postures but as the fundamental movement vectors of the system. This transforms 84 from a mystical number into literal directed-motion degrees of freedom.",
