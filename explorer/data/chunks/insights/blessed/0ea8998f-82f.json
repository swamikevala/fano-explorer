  "insight": "Manipura's \"10 petals\" can be modeled (canonically, up to symmetry) as the 10 vertices of the incidence network of the smallest manifested plane. Concretely: start from the Fano plane PG(2,2) and choose any line L∞ as a horizon (a \"line at infinity\"). Removing L∞ produces the affine plane AG(2,2) with 4 affine points and 6 affine lines. Because this is order 2, each affine line contains exactly 2 affine points, so AG(2,2) is equivalently the complete graph K₄: the 4 points are the vertices and the 6 lines are the edges (every pair of points determines a unique line). The \"10 petals\" are then not a forced arithmetic trick but the canonical vertex set of the bipartite incidence (Levi) graph Inc(AG(2,2)): one vertex for each \"place\" (point) and one vertex for each \"path\" (line), totaling 4+6=10, with the 12 incidences as the minimal complete interaction pattern. The three points on L∞ become the three directions/parallel-classes of the affine chart (equivalently, the three perfect matchings of K₄), so \"fixing Earth/horizon\" is precisely the act that turns the fully projective, directionless world into a manifested world with directions—while keeping the resulting 10-vertex network inevitable (unique up to isomorphism) regardless of which L∞ is chosen.",
