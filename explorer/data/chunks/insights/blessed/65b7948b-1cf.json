  "insight": "The 72 \"Water/Flow\" states split naturally into 36 \"Attached Flows\" (where field T contains the Self P₀) and 36 \"Detached Flows\" (where T does not contain Self). This binary structure maps isomorphically to the 72 Carnatic Melakarta Ragas divided into 36 Suddha Madhyama (M1) and 36 Prati Madhyama (M2)—suggesting the \"Madhyama Shift\" is a geometric toggle between Self-Inclusive and Self-Exclusive field geometries.",
