## 1) The ambient object: the Fano plane as pure incidence

Let \(\mathbb{F}\) denote the Fano plane \(PG(2,2)\). It is the unique projective plane of order \(2\), characterized (up to isomorphism) by:

- \(7\) points, \(7\) lines,
- each line contains \(3\) points,
- each point lies on \(3\) lines,
- any two distinct points determine a unique line.

No coordinates are needed anywhere below; everything is incidence-only.

We will use:
- \(p,x,y,\dots\) for points,
- \(L,M,S,\dots\) for lines.

A **flag** is an incident pair \((p,L)\) with \(p\in L\).
An **anti-flag** is a non-incident pair \((p,L)\) with \(p\notin L\).

A **triangle** in \(\mathbb{F}\) means a 3-point set \(T=\{a,b,c\}\) with no three collinear (equivalently: it is not a line).

---

## 2) The first inevitability: triangles are anti‑flags (coordinate‑free)

### Lemma 2.1 (Triangle complement contains a unique line)
Let \(T\subset\mathbb{F}\) be a triangle. Then the complement \(T^c\) (the remaining \(4\) points) contains **exactly one** line \(L\) (i.e. a 3-point collinear subset), and one extra point \(p\notin L\). Thus
\[
T^c = L \cup \{p\}\quad\text{with }p\notin L.
\]

**Proof (incidence-only).**
If \(T^c\) contained no line, then \(T^c\) would be a 4-point set with no three collinear—i.e. a **quadrangle**—but in the Fano plane quadrangles are exactly complements of lines, so \(T\) would be a line, contradicting that \(T\) is a triangle. Hence \(T^c\) contains a line.

Uniqueness: two distinct lines intersect in exactly one point, so they cannot both fit inside a 4-point set (they would contribute at least \(3+3-1=5\) points). ∎

### Corollary 2.2 (Canonical bijection: triangles \(\leftrightarrow\) anti‑flags)
Given a triangle \(T\), define \(\Phi(T)=(p,L)\) where \(T^c=L\cup\{p\}\) as above. This produces an anti‑flag \((p,L)\) because \(p\notin L\).

Conversely, given an anti‑flag \((p,L)\), define \(T=\mathbb{F}\setminus(L\cup\{p\})\). Then \(T\) is a 3-point set that cannot be a line (otherwise its complement would be a quadrangle rather than \(L\cup\{p\}\)), hence \(T\) is a triangle, and this inverts \(\Phi\).

So **triangles and anti‑flags are the same data**, expressed in two complementary ways.

### Count check (forces “28”)
- Total 3-point subsets: \(\binom{7}{3}=35\).
- Collinear triples are exactly the \(7\) lines.
- Hence triangles: \(35-7=28\).

Also, anti‑flags:
- choose \(p\) in \(7\) ways,
- choose a line \(L\) not through \(p\): there are \(4\) such lines,
so \(7\cdot4=28\).

The bijection is therefore not just plausible: it is numerically and structurally tight.

---

## 3) The canonical 112: “pointed anti‑flags” and “point–triangle anti‑incidence”

There are two equivalent (and complementary) clean definitions of the 112.

### Definition A (pointed anti‑flag)
Let
\[
\mathcal{C}_{112}=\{(p,L,x):\ p\notin L,\ x\in L\cup\{p\}\}.
\]
Interpretation: choose an anti‑flag \((p,L)\), then choose one of the “4 external points” \(x\) inside the canonical 3+1 split \(L\cup\{p\}\).

Size is forced:
\[
|\mathcal{C}_{112}| = |\{\text{anti‑flags}\}|\cdot 4 = 28\cdot4 = 112.
\]

This makes the intrinsic “3+1” split in the triangle complement explicit: the “four remaining points” really are “a line plus a nucleus”.

### Definition B (the union worry removed): point–triangle anti‑incidence
Let
\[
\mathcal{C}_{112}\ \cong\ \{(x,T):\ x\ \text{a point},\ T\ \text{a triangle},\ x\notin T\}.
\]
Interpretation: the 112 objects are exactly **anti‑incidences between points and triangles**.

Why is this the same 112? Because:
- triangles \(\leftrightarrow\) anti‑flags (Section 2),
- “\(x\notin T\)” is exactly “\(x\in T^c=L\cup\{p\}\)”.

This symmetric formulation removes the “why take \(L\cup\{p\}\)?” concern: it is simply the complement condition \(x\notin T\).

---

## 4) The unavoidable global splits: \(112=84+28\) and \(112=7\cdot16\)

### 4.1 The forced \(112=84+28\): line‑mode vs nucleus‑mode
In \((p,L,x)\in\mathcal{C}_{112}\), exactly one of the following holds:

- **Line‑mode:** \(x\in L\).  
  For each anti‑flag \((p,L)\), there are \(3\) choices of \(x\in L\).  
  Count: \(28\cdot3=84\).

- **Nucleus‑mode:** \(x=p\).  
  For each anti‑flag \((p,L)\), there is \(1\) choice \(x=p\).  
  Count: \(28\).

So
\[
112 = 84 + 28
\]
is not interpretive; it is literally “choose among the 4 points of \(L\cup\{p\}\): either one of the 3 line-points, or the nucleus”.

This is the clean mathematical version of the “3 edge-points vs 1 nucleus” dichotomy.

### 4.2 The forced \(112=7\cdot16\): grouping by the marked point
Using the symmetric form \((x,T)\) with \(x\notin T\):

Fix \(x\). How many triangles avoid \(x\)?

Total triangles: \(28\). Triangles containing \(x\) can be counted directly:
- there are \(3\) lines through \(x\),
- to form a triangle through \(x\), choose two *different* lines through \(x\) (3 choices),
- and choose one of the two other points on each selected line (\(2\cdot2=4\) choices),
so \(3\cdot4=12\) triangles contain \(x\).

Hence triangles avoiding \(x\): \(28-12=16\).
Therefore
\[
|\{(x,T):x\notin T\}| = \sum_{x}16 = 7\cdot16 = 112.
\]

So the \(7\times16\) grouping is “non-negotiable”: it is built into anti‑incidence.

---

## 5) The key local discovery: each point carries a canonical tetrahedron and \(16=4+12\)

Fix a point \(x\).

### 5.1 The tetrahedron \(K_4(x)\) (incidence-only construction)
Consider the **four lines not through \(x\)**. Treat them as the **4 vertices** of a complete graph:
\[
K_4(x).
\]
Now note: every other point \(y\neq x\) lies on exactly **two** of the lines not through \(x\) (because the third line through \(y\) is the unique line \(xy\), which *does* pass through \(x\)).  
Therefore each \(y\neq x\) canonically corresponds to the **edge** joining those two “non-\(x\)” lines.

So we get a rigid identification:
- vertices of \(K_4(x)\) ↔ lines not through \(x\) (4 of them),
- edges of \(K_4(x)\) ↔ points other than \(x\) (6 of them).

This is a purely local, purely incidence construction. No auxiliary choices.

### 5.2 Triangles avoiding \(x\) become 3-edge subgraphs of \(K_4(x)\)
A triangle \(T\) avoiding \(x\) is a 3-point subset of \(\mathbb{F}\setminus\{x\}\), hence a 3-edge subset of \(K_4(x)\).

Collinearity has a simple graph translation:
- A line \(L\) not through \(x\) corresponds to a vertex \(v_L\) of \(K_4(x)\).
- The three points on \(L\) correspond exactly to the three edges incident to \(v_L\).

So a collinear triple is exactly a 3-edge **star** at one vertex.  
Therefore a triangle \(T\) avoiding \(x\) corresponds to a 3-edge subset that is **not** a star.

But in \(K_4\), any 3-edge subset that is not a star is *forced* to be one of exactly two shapes:
- a 3-cycle (a triangular face),
- or a Hamiltonian path of length 3 (a spanning path through all 4 vertices).

Thus the 16 states at \(x\) split canonically as:
\[
16 = 4\ (\text{faces})\ +\ 12\ (\text{Hamiltonian paths}).
\]

This gives a mathematically rigid meaning to “4 nucleus-modes + 12 line-modes”:
- the **4** are literally the tetrahedron’s 4 triangular faces (closed loops),
- the **12** are literally the tetrahedron’s 12 spanning traversals (open flows).

No “shatkona fixation” is needed to obtain \(4+12\). It is local geometry.

### 5.3 Two canonical factorizations of “12”
Inside \(K_4(x)\), the 12 Hamiltonian paths satisfy:
- \(12 = \frac{4!}{2}\): order the 4 vertices, then forget reversal.
- \(12 = 3\cdot4\): choose a perfect matching (3 choices) and then choose one additional edge not in that matching (4 choices); together they form a unique Hamiltonian path.

This matters because it supplies multiple independent “handles” on the same 12, useful when testing structural identifications (rather than just matching a number).

### 5.4 A directed refinement hits \(|PSL(2,7)|\)
If one orients each Hamiltonian path (choose a direction along the path), each undirected path yields 2 directed ones, giving \(24\) directed traversals at each \(x\). Then:
\[
7\cdot24 = 168 = |PSL(2,7)|.
\]
This is a genuinely rigid bridge between “local directed flow choices” and the full automorphism group size.

---

## 6) “14 nadis” as a clean design duality (and how to avoid a category error)

The 7 lines form the Steiner system \(2\text{–}(7,3,1)\): every pair of points lies on exactly one line.

Taking complements sends each line (3 points) to a 4-point block (a quadrangle), and these 7 quadrangles form the dual design \(2\text{–}(7,4,2)\).

So “7 lines + 7 complementary quadrangles” is not metaphorical structure added from outside; it is the canonical complement involution on the unique \(v=7\) design.

**Addressing the ‘line vs quadrangle’ dissonance:**  
Yes, a line is geometrically different from its 4-point complement. But in the local tetrahedral dictionary (Section 5), both become honest 1-dimensional subgraphs:
- a line through \(x\) corresponds to a perfect matching in \(K_4(x)\) (two disjoint edges),
- its complementary quadrangle corresponds to the remaining 4 edges, which form a 4-cycle.

Matching and 4-cycle are both graph-theoretic “channels” (1D combinatorial objects), so defining “flow” on both is type-consistent.

---

## 7) The shatkona/axis split \(12,72,4,6,6,12\): what is forced, and what is relative

### 7.1 What changes when you pick \((C\in S)\)
Choosing a distinguished line \(S\) and a distinguished point \(C\in S\) is not intrinsic to \(\mathbb{F}\); it is adding an **observer’s frame** (a pointed line, i.e. a flag). This breaks the full symmetry group \(PSL(2,7)\) down to the stabilizer of that flag.

However, this is not “arbitrary numerology” in the mathematical sense:
- \(PSL(2,7)\) acts transitively on flags, so any choice of \((C\in S)\) yields an isomorphic decomposition.
- the resulting number-splits are then **orbit decompositions** under the stabilizer subgroup—standard, reproducible, and checkable.

So the split is **relative but canonical once the observer is specified**.

### 7.2 Exact derivation of the target split
Recall the global split:
\[
112 = 84\ (\text{line-mode})\ +\ 28\ (\text{nucleus-mode}).
\]

#### (A) Refining the 84 by whether \(L=S\)
Line-mode objects are \((p,L,x)\) with \(p\notin L\) and \(x\in L\).

- If \(L=S\):  
  \(x\in S\) gives 3 choices, and \(p\notin S\) gives 4 choices, so \(3\cdot4=12\).

- If \(L\neq S\):  
  there are 6 such lines \(L\), for each \(x\in L\) gives 3 choices, and \(p\notin L\) gives 4 choices, so \(6\cdot3\cdot4=72\).

Thus
\[
84 = 12 + 72.
\]

#### (B) Refining the 28 nucleus-mode anti‑flags using \((S,C)\)
Nucleus-mode objects are \((p,L,x=p)\), i.e. just anti‑flags \((p,L)\). So we count anti‑flags relative to \(S\) and \(C\).

- If \(L=S\): then \(p\notin S\), giving \(4\).  
  (This is the “4”.)

Now consider \(L\neq S\). Partition by whether \(p\in S\) or \(p\notin S\).

- Points on \(S\): there are 3 choices for \(p\in S\).  
  Any line \(L\) with \(p\notin L\) automatically has \(L\neq S\) because \(S\) passes through \(p\).  
  For each \(p\), there are 4 lines not through \(p\).  
  So this contributes \(3\cdot4=12\).  
  (This is the final “12”.)

- Points off \(S\): there are 4 choices for \(p\notin S\).  
  For such \(p\), among the 4 lines not through \(p\), exactly one is \(S\). Excluding it leaves 3 possibilities for \(L\neq S\).  
  So off-axis anti-flags contribute \(4\cdot3=12\).

Now use the chosen center point \(C\in S\):
the two non-\(S\) lines through \(C\) partition the 4 off-\(S\) points into two pairs (each line through \(C\) meets the off-\(S\) set in exactly two points). Each off-\(S\) point \(p\) has exactly 3 choices of \(L\neq S\) with \(p\notin L\), so each pair contributes \(2\cdot3=6\).

Thus the off-axis part splits as \(6+6\).

Putting nucleus-mode together:
\[
28 = 4 + 6 + 6 + 12.
\]

#### (C) The full target split
Combine (A) and (B):
\[
112 = (12+72) + (4+6+6+12),
\]
i.e.
\[
112 = 12,\ 72,\ 4,\ 6,\ 6,\ 12.
\]

This is an exact counting theorem once a pointed line \((C\in S)\) is fixed.

## 8) Dynamics: Heawood paths as a precise “flow” model

The point–line incidence graph of \(\mathbb{F}\) is the **Heawood graph**, a 14-vertex bipartite graph (7 points + 7 lines).

For a line-mode object \((p,L,x)\) with \(x\in L\) and \(p\notin L\), let \(M\) be the unique line through \(p\) and \(x\). Then
\[
p \;\to\; M \;\to\; x \;\to\; L
\]
is a length-3 path in the incidence graph.

This turns “micro‑states” into actual combinatorial motions, making it plausible (in a strict mathematical sense) to seek larger “channel counts” as walk-counts or spectral invariants on graphs derived from the 84- or 112-sets.

A caution is warranted here: extracting a specific large number (e.g. \(72{,}000\)) is *not* currently forced by the group size or the immediate set sizes. If such a number is to be “discovered” rather than multiplied in by hand, it should appear as:
- a closed-walk count of fixed length,
- a covering-space growth rate,
- a spectral coefficient/eigenvalue multiplicity,
- or an orbit count in a larger natural action.
At present, this remains speculative.

---

## 9) What is inevitable vs what remains speculative

### Inevitable (geometry forces it)
- Triangles \(\leftrightarrow\) anti‑flags, with the intrinsic \(3+1\) complement split.
- The canonical 112 as pointed anti‑flags, equivalently point–triangle anti‑incidence.
- The decompositions \(112=84+28\) and \(112=7\cdot16\).
- The local tetrahedral model \(K_4(x)\) and the forced refinement \(16=4+12\).
- The design duality “7 lines + 7 complementary quadrangles” and its clean graph translation.

### Relative but canonical once an “observer frame” is chosen
- Any split that depends on selecting a distinguished \((C\in S)\), including
  \[
  112 = 12+72+4+6+6+12.
  \]
This is not intrinsic to the bare Fano plane, but it *is* intrinsic to the pair \((\mathbb{F}, C\in S)\), and all such choices are equivalent under \(PSL(2,7)\).

### Speculative (needs structure preservation, not just matching sizes)
- A \(PSL(2,7)\)-equivariant identification of the **84 line-modes** with the **84 edges** of the Klein quartic \(\{3,7\}\) tessellation is plausible because both are natural \(PSL(2,7)\)-sets of size 84; but it is only meaningful if it respects a chosen adjacency/geometry on both sides.
- Any attempt to produce \(72{,}000\) must be anchored to a rigid invariant (walk counts, spectra, coverings, or an enlarged natural action). Otherwise it will drift into “attached multiplier” territory.

---

## 10) Concrete next mathematical tests (to keep coincidences honest)
1. **Define an adjacency on the 84** (e.g. two line-modes adjacent if their local Hamiltonian paths share a 2-edge subpath, or if they share an anti‑flag \((p,L)\), etc.) and compare it to edge adjacency on the Klein tessellation. If the graphs match (isomorphism + equivariance), the bridge becomes structural.
2. **Study the 16-state graph at a point** under single-edge flips in \(K_4(x)\): compute its automorphism group and spectrum. This is the cleanest controlled “micro-dynamics” laboratory.
3. **Stabilizer-orbit explanation of shatkona refinements**: explicitly compute the stabilizer subgroup of a pointed line \((C\in S)\) inside \(PSL(2,7)\) and verify that the orbit decomposition on \(\mathcal{C}_{112}\) has sizes \(12,72,4,6,6,12\). This upgrades the split from “counting with labels” to “group-theoretic physics”.
