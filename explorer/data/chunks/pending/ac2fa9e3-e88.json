The incidence-only argument above is already complete.)\n\nSo the first “mystical-looking” number is simply:\n\\[\n28 = \\text{(noncollinear triples in the Fano plane)}.\n\\]\n\n\n## 2) Each triangle has exactly four “external” points, and they split as \\(3+1\\)\n\nFix a triangle \\(\\Delta=\\{a,b,c\\}\\).\nIts complement in the 7-point plane has size 4:\n\\[\nPG(2,2)\\setminus \\Delta = \\{ \\text{four external points}\\}.\n\\]\n\nNow look at the three side-lines of the triangle:\n\\[\n\\overline{ab},\\quad \\overline{bc},\\quad \\overline{ca}.\n\\]\nEach side-line contains exactly one further point besides its two vertices (because every line has 3 points).\nCall these three “third points” on the sides the **edge-points** of \\(\\Delta\\).\n\nThat accounts for 3 of the 4 external points.\nThe remaining external point is distinguished by a purely incidence property:\n\n- it lies on **none** of the three side-lines of \\(\\Delta\\).\n\nCall it the **nucleus** of \\(\\Delta\\), denoted \\(n_\\Delta\\).\n\nSo for every triangle, the four external points split canonically as:\n\\[\n\\{\\text{external points}\\} = \\{\\text{3 edge-points}\\} \\;\\sqcup\\; \\{\\text{1 nucleus}\\}.\n\\]\n\nThis “\\(3+1\\)” is not a choice, not coordinates, not labeling—it is forced by line size \\(=3\\).\n\n\n## 3) The 112-state space \\(\\Omega\\) and the inevitable \\(84\\sqcup 28\\) split\n\nDefine the set of “states”\n\\[\n\\Omega \\;=\\;\\{(\\Delta,x):\\ \\Delta \\text{ a triangle},\\ x\\notin \\Delta\\}.\n\\]\n\nCounting is immediate:\n- 28 choices for \\(\\Delta\\),\n- 4 choices for \\(x\\) outside \\(\\Delta\\),\nso\n\\[\n|\\Omega|=28\\cdot 4 = 112.\n\\]\n\nUsing the \\(3+1\\) split of external points, \\(\\Omega\\) decomposes canonically into two types:\n\n- **Edge-states:** \\(x\\) is one of the 3 edge-points of \\(\\Delta\\). Count: \\(28\\cdot 3=84\\).\n- **Nucleus-states:** \\(x=n_\\Delta\\). Count: \\(28\\cdot 1=28\\).\n\nSo\n\\[\n112 = 84 \\;\\sqcup\\; 28\n\\]\nis already “theorem-level inevitable” inside \\(PG(2,2)\\): it is exactly the forced \\(3+1\\) per triangle, aggregated over 28 triangles.\n\n\n## 4) Anti‑flags: the coordinate‑free reparametrization of the same 28\n\nAn **anti‑flag** is a non-incident point–line pair:\n\\[\nA \\;=\\;\\{(P,L):\\ P\\notin L\\}.\n\\]\nFor each point \\(P\\), there are 4 lines not through it, so:\n\\[\n|A|=7\\cdot 4 = 28.\n\\]\n\n### Triangle \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) anti‑flag is incidence-only and bijective\nGiven a triangle \\(\\Delta\\):\n\n- Let \\(L_\\Delta\\) be the unique line containing the three edge-points of \\(\\Delta\\).\n- Let \\(n_\\Delta\\) be the nucleus.\n\nThen \\((n_\\Delta, L_\\Delta)\\) is an anti‑flag (by construction the nucleus is not on that line), giving a map\n\\[\n\\Delta \\longmapsto (n_\\Delta, L_\\Delta)\\in A.\n\\]\n\nConversely, given an anti‑flag \\((P,L)\\), define\n\\[\n\\Delta(P,L) \\;:=\\; PG(2,2)\\setminus (\\{P\\}\\cup L).\n\\]\nThis set has exactly 3 points, and one checks purely by incidence that it is noncollinear, hence a triangle.\n\nThese two constructions are inverse.\nSo the 28 triangles and the 28 anti‑flags are the *same* 28-object, presented in two languages:\n\\[\n\\{\\text{triangles}\\}\\;\\cong\\;\\{\\text{anti‑flags}\\}.\n\\]\n\nThis resolves a key ambiguity: if a later bridge to another geometry naturally produces anti‑flags, triangles come along for free (as a derived presentation), and vice versa.\n\n\n## 5) The cleanest internal model of \\(\\Omega\\): a 28-set with a forced 4-fiber\n\nUnder the triangle \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) anti‑flag identification, every triangle corresponds to an anti‑flag \\((P,L)\\),\nand its four external points become exactly the 4-point set\n\\[\nL\\cup\\{P\\}.\n\\]\n\nHence there is a canonical reparametrization:\n\\[\n\\Omega \\;\\cong\\; \\{(P,L,u):\\ (P,L)\\in A,\\ u\\in L\\cup\\{P\\}\\}.\n\\]\n\nNow the \\(84\\sqcup 28\\) split becomes even sharper:\n\n- \\(u=P\\) are the 28 nucleus-states.\n- \\(u\\in L\\) are the 84 edge-states (3 choices per anti‑flag).\n\nSo the number structure is literally:\n\\[\n112=28\\cdot 4,\\qquad 84=28\\cdot 3,\\qquad 28=28\\cdot 1,\n\\]\nwith the \\(3+1\\) coming from “points on a line” versus “the off-line point” in an anti‑flag.\n\n\n## 6) Matroid meaning: the split is “circuit size 3 vs 4”\n\nInterpreting the Fano plane as the rank‑3 Fano matroid \\(F_7\\):\n\n- a triangle \\(\\Delta\\) is a **basis** (3 independent points),\n- a state \\((\\Delta,x)\\) is “an element outside a basis.”\n\nAdd \\(x\\) to the basis. In a matroid, \\(B\\cup\\{e\\}\\) contains a unique **fundamental circuit** \\(C(B,e)\\).\n\nIn the Fano matroid, there are exactly two possibilities:\n\n- If \\(x\\) is an edge-point, then \\(x\\) lies on a side-line with two vertices of \\(\\Delta\\),\n  so the fundamental circuit has size 3 (a line).\n- If \\(x\\) is the nucleus, it lies on no side-line, and the fundamental circuit has size 4.\n\nThus the \\(84\\sqcup 28\\) split can be read without geometry at all:\n\\[\n\\Omega = \\{\\text{states with }|C|=3\\}\\;\\sqcup\\;\\{\\text{states with }|C|=4\\}.\n\\]\nThis is one of the strongest “inevitability certificates” available: it is a matroid invariant.\n\nA canonical “pivot” move (basis exchange through the fundamental circuit) yields a fully forced *local* dynamical picture:\n- edge-states break into 28 disjoint triangles (\\(28\\) copies of \\(K_3\\)),\n- nucleus-states break into 7 disjoint 4-cliques (\\(7\\) copies of \\(K_4\\)) indexed by lines via complementary quadrangles.\nThis is structurally real, though it is deliberately “too local” to generate long global cycles by itself.\n\n\n## 7) The \\(7\\times 16\\) blocks and the tetrahedral micro-geometry at each point\n\nFix a point \\(P\\).\nConsider\n\\[\n\\Omega_P=\\{(\\Delta,P):\\ P\\notin \\Delta\\}.\n\\]\nIts size is the number of triangles avoiding \\(P\\), which is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} - 4 = 20-4=16,\n\\]\nbecause among triples of the remaining 6 points, exactly 4 are collinear (the 4 lines not through \\(P\\)).\n\nSo \\(\\Omega\\) partitions canonically as\n\\[\n\\Omega = \\bigsqcup_{P\\in PG(2,2)} \\Omega_P,\\qquad |\\Omega_P|=16,\n\\]\ngiving the rigid “\\(7\\times 16\\)” structure.\n\nEven better: deleting \\(P\\) leaves the classical \\((6_2,4_3)\\) configuration, incidence-isomorphic to:\n- 6 edges of a tetrahedron (\\(K_4\\)),\n- 4 triangular faces.\n\nA 3-point subset of the 6 remaining points is a triangle (noncollinear triple) iff it is **not** a face, i.e. iff it is a **spanning tree** of \\(K_4\\).\nCayley’s formula gives \\(\\#\\text{trees}(K_4)=4^{4-2}=16\\), explaining “16” as tetrahedral inevitability, not counting luck.\n\n\n## 8) Choosing a line refines counts as \\(84=12+72\\) and \\(28=4+12+12\\)\n\nNow we intentionally break symmetry by fixing a distinguished line \\(L\\) (a “channel” choice).\n\n### Edge-states: \\(84=12+72\\)\nA triangle has \\(L\\) as a side iff it contains exactly two points of \\(L\\) and one point off \\(L\\).\nCount:\n\\[\n\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot 4 = 3\\cdot 4=12.\n\\]\nEach such triangle contributes exactly one edge-state whose chosen edge-point lies on the side \\(L\\).\nSo among the 84 edge-states, exactly 12 are “supported on \\(L\\),” leaving 72.\nBy line-symmetry, the remaining 72 split equally across the other 6 lines as \\(6\\cdot 12\\).\n\n### Nucleus-states: \\(28=4+12+12\\)\nClassify triangles by \\(|\\Delta\\cap L|\\):\n\n- \\(|\\Delta\\cap L|=0\\): choose 3 points from the 4 off \\(L\\), giving \\(\\binom{4}{3}=4\\).\n- \\(|\\Delta\\cap L|=2\\): choose 2 points on \\(L\\) and 1 off \\(L\\): \\(\\binom{3}{2}\\cdot 4=12\\).\n- \\(|\\Delta\\cap L|=1\\): the remaining \\(28-4-12=12\\).\n\nIn the \\(|\\Delta\\cap L|=1\\) case, a rigid projective fact holds: the nucleus lies on \\(L\\).\nSo \\(28=4+12+12\\) is also incidence-driven once a line is chosen.\n\nA further refinement \\(12=6+6\\) requires *more* than projective structure (an order/orientation of the three points on \\(L\\)), and therefore should be treated explicitly as an extra datum rather than an invariant.\n\n\n## 9) The 14‑fold line–quadrangle duality is not a “complement trick”\n\nFor any line \\(L\\), its complement \\(Q=PG(2,2)\\setminus L\\) is a 4-point **quadrangle** (no three collinear).\nConversely, the three diagonal intersection points of that quadrangle reconstruct the line \\(L\\).\n\nThus “line \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) complementary quadrangle” is a rigid involution, producing a principled\n\\[\n7+7 = 14\n\\]\ndouble system inside the Fano plane.\n\n\n## 10) A canonical 28‑vertex graph on anti‑flags, and the Coxeter emergence\n\nOn the 28 anti‑flags \\(A\\), define an adjacency relation (incidence-only):\n\\[\n(P,L)\\sim(Q,M)\\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad (P\\in M\\ \\text{and}\\ Q\\in L).\n\\]\nThis is the **mutual-incidence graph** \\(\\Gamma\\).\n\n### Basic forced properties (incidence-level)\nFix \\((P,L)\\).\nTo form a neighbor \\((Q,M)\\), choose:\n- \\(Q\\in L\\) (3 choices),\n- \\(M\\) a line through \\(P\\) that avoids \\(Q\\) (2 choices, since exactly one line through \\(P\\) contains \\(Q\\)).\n\nHence \\(\\Gamma\\) is 6-regular. Therefore:\n\\[\n|E(\\Gamma)|=\\frac{28\\cdot 6}{2}=84.\n\\]\n\nEach edge sits in a unique triangle, and there are exactly 28 such triangles (since \\(84/3=28\\)).\nIn fact, for an adjacent pair \\((P,L)\\sim(Q,M)\\), the third vertex of its unique triangle is\n\\[\n(R,N)=(L\\cap M,\\ \\overline{PQ}),\n\\]\nwhich is automatically an anti‑flag; this is an explicit incidence-only triangle-completion rule.\n\nSo \\(\\Gamma\\) packages a second, independent appearance of “84” and “28”:\n- 28 vertices (anti‑flags),\n- 84 edges,\n- 28 edge-disjoint triangles.\n\n### Group-theoretic forcing (what is “inevitable” here)\nLet \\(G\\cong PSL(2,7)\\) act on \\(A\\) (equivalently, the collineation group of the Fano plane).\nThe induced action on unordered pairs of anti‑flags decomposes into orbit sizes\n\\[\n168,\\ 84,\\ 42,\\ 42,\\ 42.\n\\]\nIn particular, **there is a unique 84-orbit**, and it is exactly the mutual-incidence relation above.\nSo \\(\\Gamma\\) is not “picked because it works”: it is the unique \\(G\\)-invariant 6-regular graph on \\(A\\).\n\nOne also sees an index‑2 symmetry phenomenon: \\(\\mathrm{Aut}(\\Gamma)\\) has order 336, reflecting that \\(\\Gamma\\) forgets the point/line naming and admits the point–line duality as an extra symmetry.\nThis is important conceptually: “336 vs 168” is not an error—it's the unavoidable price of a self-dual unlabeled structure.\n\n### From \\(\\Gamma\\) to the Coxeter graph \\(H\\), and a new inevitability of 112\nInside \\(\\Gamma\\), define an “opposite” relation by a purely graph-metric condition:\n\\[\nv\\perp w \\quad\\text{iff}\\quad v,w\\ \\text{have zero common neighbors in }\\Gamma.\n\\]\nThis produces a cubic graph \\(H\\) on the same 28 vertices; one verifies it is the **Coxeter graph**:\n3-regular, 28 vertices, girth 7, automorphism group of order 336.\n\nMoreover, \\(\\Gamma\\) is the **distance‑2 graph** of \\(H\\): two vertices are adjacent in \\(\\Gamma\\) exactly when they are at distance 2 in \\(H\\).\n\nNow the 112-set becomes graph-theoretically natural:\n- \\(H\\) has 28 vertices and 42 edges,\n- hence it has \\(2\\cdot 42=84\\) **oriented edges** (arcs).\n\nSo\n\\[\n112 = 28 + 84\n\\]\nreappears as\n\\[\n\\Omega \\;\\cong\\; V(H)\\ \\sqcup\\ A(H),\n\\]\ni.e. “vertices + arcs” of the Coxeter graph.\n\nConceptually, this is the cleanest “dynamics-ready” encoding:\narcs come with canonical operations (tail, head, reversal), and cycle phenomena in any arc-based motion are forced by the girth/diameter/association-scheme parameters rather than invented move rules.\n\n\n## 11) What is inevitable vs what is speculative (and why this matters)\n\n### Inevitable (incidence/matroid forced)\n- \\(28\\): noncollinear triples (triangles) in \\(PG(2,2)\\); equivalently anti‑flags.\n- \\(112=28\\cdot 4\\): triangle + external point.\n- \\(84\\sqcup 28\\): the forced \\(3+1\\) split (edge-points vs nucleus), equivalently circuit size \\(3\\) vs \\(4\\).\n- \\(7\\times 16\\): triangles avoiding a fixed point; tetrahedral \\(K_4\\) spanning-tree explanation.\n- \\(84=12+72\\) and \\(28=4+12+12\\) **once a line is fixed** (a controlled symmetry break).\n- \\(7+7=14\\): the line \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) complementary quadrangle involution.\n- The mutual-incidence graph \\(\\Gamma\\) on anti‑flags as the unique \\(G\\)-invariant 6-regular adjacency, and the Coxeter/arc reinterpretation \\(112=28+84\\).\n\n### Choice-dependent (symmetry breaking or extra gauge)\n- Any “XOR parity” phrasing is coordinate-gauge dependent unless translated back into incidence statements.\n- Refinements like \\(12=6+6\\) require an ordering/orientation on a chosen line—extra structure beyond projective incidence.\n- Any Lie-root numerology (e.g., “112 roots of \\(D_8\\)”) is **suggestive but not structural** until made equivariant (an explicit action matching the same symmetries and adjacency).\n\n### Speculative bridge (Klein quartic side)\nThe compelling (but still conditional) bridge is group-theoretic:\nthe Klein quartic’s automorphism group is \\(PSL(2,7)\\), and its 28 bitangents form a \\(G\\)-set of type \\(G/S_3\\), matching the anti‑flag/triangle 28-set.\nThis guarantees *equivariant identifications exist*, but not a canonical one without pinning down which abstract \\(G\\) is “the same” on both sides (an outer automorphism / index‑2 subtlety can intervene).\n\nA robust strategy suggested by the Fano-side synthesis is:\ndon’t demand “bitangent × 4” prematurely;\ninstead, look for an intrinsic geometric predicate on pairs of bitangents that realizes the **42-edge Coxeter relation** (or the uniquely forced 84-relation) on the Klein side.\nIf such a predicate is found, the Klein-side 112 becomes “bitangents + oriented Coxeter adjacencies” in one stroke, mirroring \\(\\Omega\\cong V(H)\\sqcup A(H)\\).\n\n\n## 12) The punchline: why these numbers keep reappearing\n\nThe repeating numerology dissolves into structure:\n\n- **28** is the fundamental 28-object (triangles ⇄ anti‑flags).\n- **4** is the forced fiber \\(L\\cup\\{P\\}\\) over each anti‑flag.\n- **112** is therefore \\(28\\times 4\\) with no slack.\n- **84/28** is the forced \\(3+1\\) split inside each fiber, equivalently circuit size \\(3\\) vs \\(4\\).\n- **7×16** is forced by deleting a point (tetrahedral micro-geometry).\n- **12+72** and **4+12+12** are forced once you choose a line (a controlled “channel” selection).\n- **7+7** is forced by the line–quadrangle involution.\n- The **Coxeter graph** emergence packages the same counts into a canonical “vertices + arcs” machine, suitable for dynamics without inventing rules.\n\nIn short: the Fano‑112 package is not a pile of coincidences; it is a rigid combinatorial object with multiple independent presentations (incidence, matroid, group action, and graph metric), and those redundancies are exactly what “discovered structure” looks like.",
