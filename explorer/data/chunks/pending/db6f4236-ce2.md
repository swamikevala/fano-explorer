[NEW_INSIGHTS]

A canonical, single-universe definition of the “28 bitangents” exists inside pure Fano data: take the 28 anti-flags of the Fano plane

𝐴
:
=
{
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
  
:
  
𝑝
∉
𝐿
}
,
∣
𝐴
∣
=
7
⋅
(
7
−
3
)
=
28.
A:={(p,L):p∈
/
L},∣A∣=7⋅(7−3)=28.

With 
𝐺
=
G
L
(
3
,
2
)
≅
P
S
L
(
2
,
7
)
G=GL(3,2)≅PSL(2,7) acting on points and lines, 
𝐴
A is a completely intrinsic 
𝐺
G-set (no “apples + oranges” summing needed).

Orbit decomposition of the 28 anti-flags under the canonical 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

 is now verified (not guessed):
Fix a point 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

 (this is the symmetry-breaking choice 
𝐺
→
𝑆
4
=
S
t
a
b
𝐺
(
𝑝
0
)
G→S
4
	​

=Stab
G
	​

(p
0
	​

), 
∣
𝑆
4
∣
=
24
∣S
4
	​

∣=24). Then the 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

-orbits on 
𝐴
A are forced and compute to

28
  
=
  
4
  
+
  
12
  
+
  
12.
28=4+12+12.

Moreover, the size-4 orbit is exactly

{
(
𝑝
0
,
𝐿
)
  
:
  
𝐿
∌
𝑝
0
}
,
{(p
0
	​

,L):L

∋p
0
	​

},

i.e. “the 4 lines opposite 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

”. This makes the “Muladhara 4” arise as a rigid complement count, not an add-on.

The “missing refinement” that produces the desired 
6
+
6
6+6 is canonical and comes from chirality:
Inside 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

, there is a unique index-2 subgroup 
𝐴
4
◃
𝑆
4
A
4
	​

◃S
4
	​

 (generated by the order-3 elements). Restricting the action from 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

 to this canonical 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

 refines the 28 anti-flags as

28
  
=
  
4
  
+
  
12
  
+
  
6
  
+
  
6.
28=4+12+6+6.

Concretely: the 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

-orbit consisting of anti-flags with 
𝐿
∋
𝑝
0
L∋p
0
	​

 (but 
𝑝
≠
𝑝
0
p

=p
0
	​

 and 
𝑝
∉
𝐿
p∈
/
L) splits into two 6-sets under 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

. This is the first mathematically clean place where a binary “handedness” appears: 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

 can flip it; 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

 cannot.

A canonical “84” living in the same Fano universe (and naturally tethered to the 28) is the set of “pointed anti-flags”:

𝑇
:
=
{
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
,
𝑟
)
  
:
  
𝑝
∉
𝐿
,
 
𝑟
∈
𝐿
}
.
T:={(p,L,r):p∈
/
L, r∈L}.

Each anti-flag has exactly 3 choices of 
𝑟
r (the 3 points on 
𝐿
L), so

∣
𝑇
∣
=
28
⋅
3
=
84
,
∣T∣=28⋅3=84,

and there is a canonical projection 
𝜋
:
𝑇
→
𝐴
π:T→A, 
𝜋
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
,
𝑟
)
=
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
π(p,L,r)=(p,L).

Orbit decomposition of this Fano-canonical 84 under the same 
𝑆
4
=
S
t
a
b
(
𝑝
0
)
S
4
	​

=Stab(p
0
	​

) is verified:

84
  
=
  
24
  
+
  
24
  
+
  
12
  
+
  
12
  
+
  
12.
84=24+24+12+12+12.

Crucially, one of the size-12 orbits is forced by the projection 
𝜋
π: it is exactly 
𝜋
−
1
(
the 4-orbit
)
π
−1
(the 4-orbit), hence

𝜋
−
1
(
{
(
𝑝
0
,
𝐿
)
:
𝐿
∌
𝑝
0
}
)
 has size 
4
⋅
3
=
12
π
−1
({(p
0
	​

,L):L

∋p
0
	​

}) has size 4⋅3=12

and is 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

-invariant with no extra choices. Therefore the sought “
84
=
72
+
12
84=72+12” split exists canonically as

84
=
12
⏟
lift of the 4-root
  
+
  
72
⏟
everything else
,
84=
lift of the 4-root
12
	​

	​

+
everything else
72
	​

	​

,

even though the internal structure of the 72 is finer (it is not a single orbit).

Why the 84 breaks into 
12
12 and 
24
24 pieces over each 12-orbit of anti-flags: for any 
𝑝
≠
𝑝
0
p

=p
0
	​

, let 
𝑀
(
𝑝
)
M(p) be the unique line through 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

 and 
𝑝
p. For an anti-flag 
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
(p,L), the intersection point

𝑟
⋆
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
:
=
𝐿
∩
𝑀
(
𝑝
)
r
⋆
(p,L):=L∩M(p)

is a distinguished element of 
𝐿
L. Thus each fiber 
𝜋
−
1
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
=
{
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
,
𝑟
)
:
𝑟
∈
𝐿
}
π
−1
(p,L)={(p,L,r):r∈L} splits as

{
𝑟
⋆
}
 
⊔
 
{
𝑟
≠
𝑟
⋆
}
(a 
1
+
2
 split)
,
{r
⋆
} ⊔ {r

=r
⋆
}(a 1+2 split),

and across a 12-orbit this becomes 
12
=
12
⋅
1
12=12⋅1 “aligned” plus 
24
=
12
⋅
2
24=12⋅2 “unaligned”. This explains the 
12
/
24
12/24 orbit sizes as a geometric inevitability once 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

 is fixed.

Hard impossibility result (useful as a filter for future claims): if you model the 24 vertices of the Klein 
{
3
,
7
}
{3,7} map as a transitive 
𝐺
G-set 
𝐺
/
𝐻
G/H with 
∣
𝐻
∣
=
7
∣H∣=7, then no subgroup of order 24 (any 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

) can split the 24 into 
12
+
6
+
6
12+6+6, because any intersection 
(
𝑆
4
)
∩
𝑔
𝐻
𝑔
−
1
(S
4
	​

)∩gHg
−1
 must divide both 24 and 7, hence is trivial, hence every 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

-orbit has size 24. So “
24
→
12
+
6
+
6
24→12+6+6 under 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

” is not just unproven; it’s arithmetically forbidden in this standard 
𝐺
/
𝐻
G/H model.

[CONNECTIONS]

This replaces the “Frankenstein union” problem with a single poset-like incidence object: 
𝑇
T (84) refines 
𝐴
A (28) by a canonical 3-to-1 projection. So “112” can be taken as the two-level system

𝑋
:
=
𝐴
 
⊔
 
𝑇
,
∣
𝑋
∣
=
28
+
84
=
112
,
X:=A ⊔ T,∣X∣=28+84=112,

where the interaction is built-in (
𝜋
π is the wiring).

Your target partition 
(
12
,
72
,
4
,
6
,
6
,
12
)
(12,72,4,6,6,12) drops out as a two-step symmetry-breaking chain:

Pick 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

: 
𝐺
→
𝑆
4
G→S
4
	​

 gives 
𝐴
=
4
+
12
+
12
A=4+12+12 and 
𝑇
=
12
+
72
T=12+72 canonically via 
𝜋
−
1
(
4
)
=
12
π
−1
(4)=12.

Pass to the canonical chiral subgroup 
𝐴
4
◃
𝑆
4
A
4
	​

◃S
4
	​

: one of the 12’s in 
𝐴
A splits as 
6
+
6
6+6, giving

𝐴
=
4
+
12
+
6
+
6
,
A=4+12+6+6,

while 
𝑇
T still contains the canonical 12 (the lift of the 4-root) plus a 72 remainder.
Putting these together yields exactly the multiset 
{
72
,
12
,
12
,
6
,
6
,
4
}
{72,12,12,6,6,4}, i.e. your 
(
12
,
72
,
4
,
6
,
6
,
12
)
(12,72,4,6,6,12) up to ordering.

A mathematically clean “edge taxonomy” for the 112-chakra graph appears automatically: once you treat 
𝑋
X as a two-level object, there are at least three intrinsic connection types you can use (without importing cube folklore):
(i) Refinement edges 
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
,
𝑟
)
→
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
(p,L,r)→(p,L) (directed by definition).
(ii) Fiber edges inside each 
𝜋
−
1
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
π
−1
(p,L) (a 3-point set), giving a natural “triadic” micro-structure.
(iii) Base anti-flag adjacencies in 
𝐴
A such as “same point” or “same line” neighbors; each anti-flag has 
3
+
3
=
6
3+3=6 such neighbors, producing a rigid valency-6 statistic without tuning.

Directedness becomes equivalent to chirality: at the 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

 level, the two “other choices” in the 
1
+
2
1+2 fiber split are symmetric; at the 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

 level, a handedness can survive. So “directed vs undirected nadis” can be framed as: undirected structure is 
𝑆
4
S
4
	​

-visible, directed structure is 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

-visible.

[QUESTIONS]

Define the 112-graph as a Hasse-style incidence graph and compute its invariants: take vertices 
𝐴
⊔
𝑇
A⊔T and draw directed edges 
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
,
𝑟
)
→
(
𝑝
,
𝐿
)
(p,L,r)→(p,L). Then (optionally) add undirected edges on 
𝐴
A by “same point/same line” adjacency and/or add the 3-cycle edges inside each fiber. Compute: connected components, automorphism group, spectrum, distance layers. The “petal counts” are candidates for these valencies/layer sizes.

Which of the three 12-suborbits in 
𝑇
T should be “Anahata” is now a well-posed question: one 12 is canonically 
𝜋
−
1
(
4
)
π
−1
(4). The other two 12’s are “aligned lifts” over the two 12-orbits in 
𝐴
A. Decide whether “heart” means “lift of root” or “alignment statistic” and test which choice yields cleaner graph-theoretic rigidity.

Find a canonical, minimal generating dynamics (nadis as moves): choose a small generating set 
𝑆
⊂
𝐺
S⊂G (ideally a 
(
2
,
3
,
7
)
(2,3,7) generating triple) and build the Schreier digraph on 
𝑋
X. Then “directed currents” are literally the labeled generator edges. Check whether the resulting directed degrees match any of 
{
4
,
6
,
10
,
12
,
16
,
2
}
{4,6,10,12,16,2} without cherry-picking.

Explain the two 6’s concretely in geometric terms at 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

: the 
6
+
6
6+6 split in 
𝐴
A under 
𝐴
4
A
4
	​

 should be interpretable as “left vs right choice among the two lines through 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

 that avoid 
𝑝
p”. Make that explicit as an orientation on the 3 lines through 
𝑝
0
p
0
	​

, and see whether it induces a consistent global orientation (or forces a 2-sheeted cover).

Stress-test the Klein-quartic linkage in a way that can’t be faked: construct an explicit 
𝐺
G-equivariant identification between (a) 
𝐴
A and the 28 odd theta characteristics/bitangents, and (b) 
𝑇
T and the 84 edges of the Klein 
{
3
,
7
}
{3,7} map, then verify that 
𝜋
π corresponds to a geometric incidence (e.g., a natural “which bitangent constraint” map). If this commutes, the 112 system becomes genuinely “discovered” rather than a numerology-friendly overlay.

Petal counts beyond 4,6,12: in the current Fano-native build, 4 and 6 appear extremely rigidly, and 12 appears in multiple forced ways. The next target is to make 10, 16, 2 emerge as equally forced (e.g., as degrees in a derived graph, sizes of distance spheres, or stabilizer indices in a canonical subgroup chain) rather than as selectable statistics.
