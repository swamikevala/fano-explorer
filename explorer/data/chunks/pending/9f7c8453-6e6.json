It has:\n\n- 7 points and 7 lines,\n- 3 points on each line,\n- 3 lines through each point,\n- any two distinct points determine a unique line.\n\nFix a point \\(p \\in \\mathbb{F}\\). The remaining points (the “outer” points relative to \\(p\\)) are the other 6 points of \\(\\mathbb{F}\\).\n\nA **triangle** in the Fano plane means a 3-point subset that is **not** collinear (i.e., not a line).\n\nWe focus on the triangles that **contain** the fixed point \\(p\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta = \\{p,a,b\\} \\quad\\text{with } a,b\\neq p.\n\\]\nThis triple is *not* a triangle exactly when \\(a,b\\) lie with \\(p\\) on one of the 3 lines through \\(p\\). Each of those 3 lines contributes exactly one “forbidden pair” \\(\\{a,b\\}\\).\n\nSo the number of noncollinear triples \\(\\{p,a,b\\}\\) is\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{2} - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12.\n\\]\n\n**Inevitable number #1: \\(12\\).**  \nIt is forced purely by the incidence axioms of the Fano plane once \\(p\\) is fixed.\n\n(These 12 objects are what the exploration calls the “tangential triangles through \\(p\\)”.)\n\n\n## 2) The canonical bijection: triangles through \\(p\\) ↔ flags on lines not through \\(p\\)\n\nAmong the 7 lines of \\(\\mathbb{F}\\), exactly 3 pass through \\(p\\). Therefore the number of lines **not** through \\(p\\) is\n\\[\n7-3 = 4.\n\\]\nCall these four lines \\(L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4\\).\n\nNow take one of the 12 triangles \\(\\Delta=\\{p,a,b\\}\\). Since \\(\\{p,a,b\\}\\) is noncollinear, the line through \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) does *not* contain \\(p\\). Let\n- \\(L\\) be the line \\(ab\\), so \\(p\\notin L\\),\n- \\(c\\) be the third point on \\(L\\) (the unique point \\(c\\neq a,b\\) with \\(\\{a,b,c\\}=L\\)).\n\nDefine the map\n\\[\n\\{p,a,b\\} \\longmapsto (L,c).\n\\]\n\nConversely, given a line \\(L\\) not through \\(p\\) and a chosen point \\(c\\in L\\), the other two points of \\(L\\) form \\(L\\setminus\\{c\\}\\), and\n\\[\n(L,c)\\longmapsto \\{p\\}\\cup(L\\setminus\\{c\\})\n\\]\nis a triangle through \\(p\\).\n\nThese two constructions are inverse to each other, so we have a **canonical bijection**:\n\\[\n\\{\\text{triangles through }p\\}\\ \\cong\\ \\{(L,c): L\\not\\ni p,\\ c\\in L\\}.\n\\]\n\nCounting on the right side gives the same forced \\(12\\):\n- 4 choices of \\(L\\) (lines avoiding \\(p\\)),\n- 3 choices of \\(c\\in L\\),\nso \\(4\\cdot 3 = 12\\).\n\n**Inevitable number #2: \\(4\\cdot 3 = 12\\).**  \nSame 12, now expressed as “a line not through \\(p\\), with a marked point on it”.\n\n\n## 3) The hidden tetrahedron: why \\(K_4\\) appears\n\nThe four lines \\(L_1,\\dots,L_4\\) (none containing \\(p\\)) intersect pairwise. Each pair intersects in a unique point of \\(\\mathbb{F}\\), and those intersection points are exactly the 6 outer points.\n\nThis is precisely the complete graph \\(K_4\\):\n\n- **Vertices** \\( \\leftrightarrow \\) the four lines \\(L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4\\).\n- **Edges** \\( \\leftrightarrow \\) their pairwise intersections (6 points).\n- A **flag** (vertex–edge incidence) in \\(K_4\\) is a choice of a vertex together with an incident edge.\n\nBut in \\(K_4\\),\n- each of 4 vertices has degree 3,\n- so the number of flags is \\(4\\cdot 3 = 12\\).\n\nUnder the bijection in §2, each pair \\((L,c)\\) is exactly:\n- a vertex \\(L\\) (one of the 4 lines),\n- and an incident edge (the edge corresponding to the point \\(c\\), i.e. the intersection of \\(L\\) with the other line through \\(c\\)).\n\nSo we can identify, canonically:\n\\[\n\\{\\text{12 triangles through }p\\}\n\\cong\n\\{\\text{12 flags of }K_4\\}.\n\\]\n\nA convenient representation of a flag of \\(K_4\\) is as an **oriented edge**:\n\\[\n(u,v)\\quad (u\\neq v),\n\\]\nmeaning “the edge \\(\\{u,v\\}\\) viewed from endpoint \\(u\\)”.\nThere are \\(4\\cdot 3=12\\) such ordered pairs.\n\n**Inevitable structure:** fixing \\(p\\) produces a tetrahedral \\(K_4\\) “at infinity”, and the 12 triangles through \\(p\\) are its 12 flags (half-edges).\n\n\n## 4) The truncated tetrahedron graph: a rigid 12-vertex adjacency\n\nOn the 12 flags, impose the natural adjacency:\n\nTwo flags are adjacent if either\n1. they share the same vertex of \\(K_4\\) (same line \\(L\\)), or\n2. they share the same edge of \\(K_4\\) (same intersection point \\(c\\)).\n\nIn oriented-edge language, two ordered pairs \\((u,v)\\) and \\((u',v')\\) are adjacent iff\n- \\(u=u'\\) (same start vertex), or\n- \\(\\{u,v\\}=\\{u',v'\\}\\) (same underlying undirected edge, opposite orientation).\n\nThis produces a 12-vertex, 3-regular graph. It is (up to isomorphism) the **truncated tetrahedron graph**: the 1-skeleton of the Archimedean solid obtained by truncating a tetrahedron.\n\n**Inevitable number #3: degree = 3.**  \nEach flag touches:\n- 2 other flags at the same vertex (because \\(K_4\\) has degree 3),\n- 1 opposite flag on the same edge (the reversed orientation),\nfor a total of 3 neighbors.\n\n**Inevitable symmetry:**  \nThe full automorphism group of the Fano plane has order 168. The stabilizer of a point \\(p\\) has order \\(168/7 = 24\\), and is isomorphic to \\(S_4\\). Under the identifications above, this \\(S_4\\) is exactly the symmetry group permuting the four lines not through \\(p\\), hence permuting the vertices of the tetrahedral \\(K_4\\), hence acting on the 12 flags and on the truncated-tetrahedron graph.\n\n\n## 5) Adding one outer point \\(q\\): an “axis” and an involution with orbits \\(1+1+2+2+2+2+2\\)\n\nNow add one more datum: choose an outer point \\(q\\neq p\\).\n\nIn the \\(K_4\\) picture, outer points correspond to edges. So choosing \\(q\\) is equivalent to choosing an edge of \\(K_4\\). Label the vertices of \\(K_4\\) as \\(\\{1,2,3,4\\}\\) and suppose \\(q\\) corresponds to the edge \\(\\{1,2\\}\\).\n\nA key move is to pick an involution in \\(S_4\\) associated to this chosen edge. There are multiple symmetries preserving the *unordered* edge \\(\\{1,2\\}\\), but there is a particularly clean involution:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma := (3\\,4),\n\\]\nwhich **fixes 1 and 2 pointwise** and swaps the complementary vertices 3 and 4.\n\nThis “complement-swap” is the unique nontrivial permutation that keeps both endpoints of the chosen edge individually fixed.\n\n### Orbit decomposition on the 12 flags\n\nIdentify flags with ordered pairs \\((u,v)\\), \\(u\\neq v\\). Then \\(\\sigma\\) acts by applying the permutation to both entries:\n\\[\n\\sigma(u,v) := (\\sigma(u),\\sigma(v)).\n\\]\n\nA direct check gives the orbit structure:\n- Two fixed flags:\n  \\[\n  (1,2)\\ \\text{fixed},\\quad (2,1)\\ \\text{fixed}.\n  \\]\n- Five 2-cycles:\n  \\[\n  (3,4)\\leftrightarrow(4,3),\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (1,3)\\leftrightarrow(1,4),\\quad (3,1)\\leftrightarrow(4,1),\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  (2,3)\\leftrightarrow(2,4),\\quad (3,2)\\leftrightarrow(4,2).\n  \\]\n\nSo the 12 flags split as\n\\[\n1+1+2+2+2+2+2.\n\\]\n\n**Inevitable number #4: \\(2\\) fixed + \\(10\\) moving = \\(12\\).**  \nOnce the edge \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) is chosen and we insist on an involution fixing its endpoints, this orbit structure is forced.\n\n### The “one special pair” is not a choice: it is a different orbit type\n\nAmong the five 2-cycles, one is structurally distinct:\n\n- The pair \\((3,4)\\leftrightarrow(4,3)\\) consists of two flags that share the **same undirected edge** \\(\\{3,4\\}\\). Call this an **E-type** (“edge-inverted”) pair.\n\n- The other four 2-cycles are pairs of flags that share a **vertex** (same first coordinate, or same second coordinate). Call these **V-type** (“vertex-divergent”) pairs.\n\nThus the involution produces a rigid refinement:\n\\[\n\\text{five paired orbits} = 4\\ (\\text{V-type})\\ +\\ 1\\ (\\text{E-type}).\n\\]\n\n### Extremality in the truncated tetrahedron graph\n\nIn the truncated-tetrahedron adjacency graph (from §4), the E-type pair is also distinguished by a graph-theoretic extremum:\n\n- The two fixed flags \\((1,2)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) are adjacent (they are the two orientations of the same edge \\(\\{1,2\\}\\)).\n- The two vertices \\((3,4)\\) and \\((4,3)\\) are the **unique** vertices at **maximum distance** from *both* fixed vertices; in fact their graph distance to each fixed vertex is 3.\n\nSo “one special pair” can be stated purely as:\n\n> Given the axis edge \\(\\{1,2\\}\\) and the endpoint-fixing involution \\((3\\,4)\\), there is a unique 2-cycle whose elements are simultaneously maximally distant from both fixed points in the truncated-tetrahedron graph.\n\nNo musical semantics are required to make this statement true.\n\n\n## 6) What is inevitable vs. what is interpretive (and where the model must be careful)\n\n### Inevitable (mathematical) core\n1. Fixing \\(p\\) forces exactly **12** noncollinear triples \\(\\{p,a,b\\}\\).\n2. These 12 triangles are canonically the **12 flags of \\(K_4\\)** built from the 4 lines not through \\(p\\).\n3. The natural flag adjacency produces the **truncated tetrahedron graph** (12 vertices, 3-regular, 18 edges).\n4. Choosing an outer point \\(q\\) (an edge of \\(K_4\\)) and selecting the endpoint-fixing involution forces the orbit split:\n   \\[\n   1+1+2+2+2+2+2,\n   \\]\n   with a forced refinement into\n   \\[\n   4\\ \\text{V-type pairs} + 1\\ \\text{E-type pair},\n   \\]\n   and the E-type pair is uniquely extremal by graph distance.\n\nThese facts are combinatorial necessities.\n\n### Interpretive (speculative) layer: mapping to Hindustani swaras\nA coherent way to avoid category slippage is:\n\n- Treat the fixed point \\(p\\) as a **generator / center** (a “source” object), not itself one of the 12 musical pitch-classes.\n- Treat the **12 triangles/flags** as the candidate 12 pitch-classes.\n- Treat the choice of \\(q\\) (edge/axis) plus an involution as the step that introduces a **tonal orientation** inside the 12-set.\n\nUnder that disciplined separation, the following becomes plausible as a *structural analogy*:\n\n- The two fixed flags \\((1,2)\\) and \\((2,1)\\) model two **achala** roles (often associated to Sa and Pa).\n- The five 2-cycles model the five **vikrit** swaras (each with two variants).\n- The unique E-type pair models the unique “anomalous” variable (often associated to Ma vs. tivra Ma), because it is not V-type like the other four.\n\nThis is where “the numbers match for a reason” becomes meaningful: the matching comes from orbit structure, not from arbitrary counting.\n\n### A critical caution about “adjacency = interval”\nThe truncated tetrahedron graph has two edge-types baked into its definition:\n- edges coming from “same vertex of \\(K_4\\)” (a 3-cycle structure),\n- edges coming from “same edge of \\(K_4\\)” (orientation flips).\n\nTherefore one should **not** equate graph adjacency with a single musical interval (e.g., semitone steps) without additional structure. If the graph is to encode musical relations, it more naturally supports a **two-generator** harmonic geometry (two interval-types), while a chromatic semitone cycle would correspond to choosing a **Hamiltonian 12-cycle**—which is extra data, not forced by the graph alone.\n\n\n## 7) Concrete next problems (mathematical formulation)\n\nThese are the exploration’s questions, rewritten in “clean math” form so they can be attacked without drifting into handwaving:\n\n1. **Can \\(q\\) be chosen canonically from \\(p\\)?**  \n   Inside the bare Fano plane, the stabilizer of \\(p\\) acts transitively on the 6 outer points, so there is no canonical \\(q\\) determined by \\(p\\) alone. Any rule selecting a particular outer point must import extra structure (an orientation, a labeling, an embedding, a metric, a distinguished triangle, etc.). The right question becomes: *what additional structure is philosophically/physically justified, and what does it induce on the 12 flags?*\n\n2. **Hamiltonian cycles and “chromatic order.”**  \n   Classify Hamiltonian 12-cycles in the truncated tetrahedron graph, especially those invariant (or nicely equivariant) under the chosen involution \\(\\sigma\\). Any such cycle is a candidate for a “chromatic step order,” but it is not unique a priori.\n\n3. **Interval classes from graph invariants.**  \n   Instead of forcing “distance = semitones,” use invariants that respect the remaining symmetry after choosing the axis: distances to the two fixed vertices, orbit type (V vs E), adjacency edge-type, or spectral data of the adjacency operator.\n\n4. **Extremality principle for the special pair.**  \n   The E-type pair is already uniquely characterized as “maximally distant from both fixed vertices.” One can also seek a characterization via:\n   - cuts (maximizing separation),\n   - eigenvectors/eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix stabilized by \\(\\sigma\\),\n   - uniqueness as the nontrivial 2-cycle supported on an edge disjoint from the axis edge.\n\n5. **Lifting from 12 to larger tangential sets (84, 112).**  \n   Treat the 12 flags as a “local chart” around \\(p\\). Then investigate functorial constructions from the full automorphism group action (size 168) that produce structured subsets (designs, induced subgraphs, block systems) that could serve as mathematically natural analogues of thaats/ragas.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- The pipeline\n  \\[\n  \\text{Fano} + p \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 12 \\text{ triangles} \\cong 12 \\text{ flags of }K_4 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\text{truncated tetrahedron graph}\n  \\]\n  is rigid and canonical.\n- Adding \\(q\\) and insisting on an endpoint-fixing involution produces a rigid refinement\n  \\[\n  12 = 2\\ (\\text{fixed}) + 10\\ (\\text{paired}) = 2 + (4\\text{ V-type pairs}) + (1\\text{ E-type pair}),\n  \\]\n  and the E-type pair is singled out by an intrinsic extremality property in the graph.\n\nEverything beyond that—identifying which mathematical objects “are” Sa/Pa/Ma, deciding what adjacency means musically, and selecting \\(q\\) without arbitrary symmetry breaking—belongs to the interpretive layer and must be handled as additional structure rather than as consequences of the Fano plane alone.",
