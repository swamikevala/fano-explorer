1. The Fundamental Manifold: 112 States of Detached Observation

The number 112 is often cited in Yogic lore, but mathematically, it is an intrinsic property of the Fano Plane (PG(2,2)), the simplest possible projective geometry.

We define a Chakra State not as a static point, but as an Anti-Flag: a pair (T,p) consisting of a Vortex (a Triangle T) and an Observer (a point p) that is detached from the vortex (p∈
/
T).

Triangles: The Fano plane contains exactly 28 distinct triangles.

External Points: For any triangle, there are exactly 4 points not contained in it.

The Calculation:

28 Triangles×4 Disjoint Points=112 States

This proves that 112 is the total phase space of "detached observation" in the simplest projective universe.

2. The Intrinsic Split: Flow vs. Witness (84 + 28)

Before we even introduce an individual "Self," the geometry forces a natural division within the 112 states based on incidence. For any triangle T, the 4 external points are not geometrically identical:

Conductive States (84): In 3 of the 4 cases, the observer p lies on a line extended from the sides of the triangle. These points are "in the flow" of the energy.

Calculation: 28×3=84.

Connection: These map 1:1 to the 84 Edges of the Klein Quartic {7,3} tiling. This is the "Wiring" of existence.

Radical States (28): In exactly 1 of the 4 cases, the observer p lies on no line defined by the triangle. This is the Radical Center—a point of pure orthogonality.

Calculation: 28×1=28.

Connection: These map 1:1 to the 28 Bitangents of the Klein Quartic. This is the "Witness" aspect.

3. The Observer Effect: Deriving the 12-72-4-6-6-12 Partition

The universe (112) is symmetric until we establish a frame of reference. Let us fix a single point P
0
	​

 as the "Self" (the Individual Observer). This breaks the symmetry group G
168
	​

 into the stabilizer group S
4
	​

.

This single choice precipitates the specific sequence of numbers found in Yogic traditions. The 112 states decompose into orbits relative to the Self:

A. The Seat of the Self (The "Special 4")

These are the Radical States where the Self (P
0
	​

) acts as the Witness.

There are exactly 4 triangles for which P
0
	​

 is the geometric center.

Yogic Equivalent: The Root (Mooladhara). The 4-petaled geometric anchor.

B. The Bulk Flow (The "72")

These are the Conductive States where the Self is not involved.

Total Conductive States = 84.

Minus those involving Self (12, see below) = 72.

Yogic Equivalent: The 72 Melakarta Ragas. These are the objective resonant frequencies of the universe, existing as flows external to the Self.

C. The Boundary (The "12")

These are the Conductive States where the Self (P
0
	​

) is the Witness.

The Self sits on the "line of flow" but observes it.

Yogic Equivalent: The Peripheral Awareness.

D. The Field Witnesses (The "24" splitting into 12 + 6 + 6)

These are the Radical States observed by the World (where p

=P
0
	​

). This group of 24 splits based on the Self's relationship to the triangle:

Transcendent Orbit (12): The Self (P
0
	​

) lies on a line of the triangle, but is not the observer. The Self supports the structure but is "transcended" by another witness.

Yogic Equivalent: The Void. Stable and symmetric.

Immanent Orbit (12 → 6 + 6): The Self (P
0
	​

) is a vertex of the triangle. Because the Self is part of the structure, the triangle acquires an Orientation (Left/Right neighbor relative to Self).

Under the physical law of Orientation (Group A
4
	​

), this orbit breaks into 6 Chiral Pairs.

Yogic Equivalent: Ida (Lunar/Left) and Pingala (Solar/Right). The duality of existence arises only when the Self is immanent in the structure.

5. Further Connections

114 as Primal + Dual: The "114" is not an arbitrary addition of 2 chakras, but the union of the 57 Points (Centers) and 57 Lines (Fields) of the Projective Plane PG(2,7). It represents the complete Phase Space (Position + Momentum) of the system.

50 Letters as Structure + Channel: The 50 Sanskrit letters likely map to the 36 Even Theta Characteristics (Static Potentials/Consonants) plus the 14 Heawood Vertices (Dynamic Channels/Vowels).

D8 Lattice: The 112 states map isomorphically to the root system of the Lie Algebra D
8
	​

, suggesting the chakra system is a projection of an 8-dimensional hyper-cubic crystal structure.

Conclusion

The sequence 4, 72, 12, 12, 6, 6 is not an invention of numerology. It is the necessary Symmetry Breaking Pattern of a 7-dimensional projective field when acted upon by a single point of consciousness. The numbers are discovered, not invented.
