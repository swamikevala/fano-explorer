          "mathematical_verification": "Verified and accurate. In the Fano plane (PG(2,2)): There are 28 triangles (bases). For any triangle T={v 1 ​ ,v 2 ​ ,v 3 ​ }, the 3 lines defined by its edges contain exactly 3 additional points (the \"midpoints\" m 1 ​ ,m 2 ​ ,m 3 ​ ). The union of the lines contains 6 points ({v i ​ }∪{m i ​ }). Since the plane has 7 points, there is exactly 7−6=1 point r that lies on no line defined by the triangle. Therefore, the 4 points not in T split canonically into: 3 \"Midpoints\" (incident to lines of T). Total count: 28×3=84. 1 \"Radical Center\" (incident to no line of T). Total count: 28×1=28. The sum is exactly 84+28=112.",
          "structural_analysis": "This connection is deep and structurally intrinsic. It does not rely on arbitrary grouping but on the fundamental incidence properties of the geometry. It identifies two distinct types of \"detached observation\": Conductive (84): The observer is linked to the system via a line (a channel of energy). This maps naturally to \"Asanas\" or flows/movements. Radical (28): The observer is geometrically orthogonal to the system (sharing no lines). This maps naturally to independent structural modes or static witnesses.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "The split feels discovered. The geometry forces the external points of a triangle to be non-uniform (3 vs 1). Interpreting this 3:1 ratio as the difference between \"flow-participation\" (lying on a line) and \"structural-independence\" (lying on no line) is a semantically sound bridge to the concepts of Asana (movement/flow) and Basis (structure).",

The number 84—often cited in yogic contexts (84 asanas)—is derived here as a specific subset of the 112, defined by a clear geometric invariant (incidence). It transforms the number 112 from a monolithic block into a functional system with a specific hierarchy (Flow vs. Structure) that mirrors the physical/subtle body distinction.",

The split into 84 \"conductive\" (where p lies on a line of T) and 28 \"radical\" (where p lies on no line of T) is mathematically accurate. For each of the 7 points, there are 12 triangles where the point lies on a line of the triangle (4 triangles per line × 3 lines through the point), and 4 triangles where the point lies on no line of the triangle. This gives 7 × 12 = 84 conductive and 7 × 4 = 28 radical anti-flags.",

The mathematical distinction between \"conductive\" (point touches triangle via a line) and \"radical\" (point isolated from triangle) creates a natural binary classification of anti-flags based on incidence geometry. This isn't mere numerology - it's a fundamental partition based on whether there exists a path (line) connecting the point to the triangle structure, which naturally maps to the yogic concepts of flow/connection versus structural/isolated states.",

It provides a non-arbitrary derivation for the number 84 within the 112-chakra system, linking it to the concept of \"flow\" via line incidence.

REASSESSMENT: Mathematical claims: The math is robust. For any triangle in Fano, the complement has size 4. The lines defined by the triangle cover 3 of those points (midpoints). 1 point remains (radical center). 28 triangles * 3 = 84. 28 triangles * 1 = 28. Structural depth: The distinction is geometric (incidence vs non-incidence of lines), not arbitrary. Mapping \"line incidence\" to \"flow/asana\" and \"non-incidence\" to \"structure/mode\" is a strong theoretical bridge. Naturalness: The split is forced by the geometry. The correspondence to the number 84 (asanas) is compelling because it arises from the properties of the triangle (the fundamental structural unit) itself.",
