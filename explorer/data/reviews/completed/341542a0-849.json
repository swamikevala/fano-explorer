          "mathematical_verification": "[Verified] The claim is mathematically sound based on the vector space construction of the Fano plane over the field F 2 ​ . Representation: The Fano plane points can be represented as non-zero vectors (x,y,z) in F 2 3 ​ . A \"Fano triangle\" T={a,b,c} corresponds to a set of 3 linearly independent vectors (a basis). The Complement: The space has 2 3 −1=7 points. The complement T c contains the 7−3=4 remaining vectors. Decomposition: These 4 vectors are formed by linear combinations of the basis T: The pairwise sums: a+b, b+c, c+a. The triple sum: a+b+c. Collinearity: In F 2 ​ , sum equals zero implies collinearity. (a+b)+(b+c)+(c+a)=2a+2b+2c=0. Thus, {a+b,b+c,c+a} form a line L(T). Uniqueness: The point s=a+b+c is distinct from the line L(T) (e.g., a+b+c=a+b⟹c=0, a contradiction). Counting: The 112 incidences are defined as pairs (T,p) where p∈T c . This separates the 112 pairs into sets of size 28×3=84 (where p∈L(T)) and 28×1=28 (where p=s(T)).",
          "structural_analysis": "[Deep] This insight moves beyond surface numerology to reveal a fundamental topological distinction between two types of \"chakras\" (incidence pairs) within the system. The 84 \"Planar\" Chakras: Corresponds to points lying on the dual line of the triangle. These represent relationships mediated by pairs (dyadic interactions). The 28 \"Axial\" Chakras: Corresponds to the unique sum point (the \"unit point\" in projective coordinates relative to basis T). These represent a holistic integration of the three vertices of the triangle. This effectively partitions the 112 chakras into two subsets based on their geometric role relative to their defining triangle, creating a robust starting point for deriving the user's conjectured subgroups (12, 72, etc.).",
          "naturalness_assessment": "[Inevitable] This decomposition is not an arbitrary choice; it is forced by the algebraic structure of the Fano plane. Any mathematician working with PG(2,2) would agree that a basis (triangle) naturally induces a distinction between the \"unit point\" and the \"points on the sides of the fundamental triangle\" (in the complement). It feels like a discovery, not an invention.",
          "reasoning": "This chunk is mathematically rigorous and structurally significant. It provides a hard, geometric proof for a primary split of the 112 energies (28 vs 84) which is necessary to eventually proving the more granular grouping (12, 72, 4, 6, 6, 12). It validates the \"112\" model using pure projective geometry without requiring mystical axioms.",

          "mathematical_verification": "In 𝑃 𝐺 ( 2 , 2 ) PG(2,2) (the Fano plane), any noncollinear triple 𝑇 = { 𝑎 , 𝑏 , 𝑐 } T={a,b,c} can be coordinatized as a basis of 𝐹 2 3 F 2 3 ​ (noncollinear ⇔ ⇔ no relation 𝑎 = 𝑏 + 𝑐 a=b+c, etc.). In that model the remaining four points are exactly { 𝑎 + 𝑏 , 𝑎 + 𝑐 , 𝑏 + 𝑐 , 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 } {a+b,a+c,b+c,a+b+c}, so 𝑇 𝑐 T c has the stated form. The three pairwise sums are collinear because ( 𝑎 + 𝑏 ) + ( 𝑎 + 𝑐 ) = 𝑏 + 𝑐 (a+b)+(a+c)=b+c, hence they lie on a single line; the fourth point 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 a+b+c is not on that line. The count 112 = 28 ⋅ 4 112=28⋅4 and the refinement 112 = 28 ⋅ 1 + 28 ⋅ 3 = 28 + 84 112=28⋅1+28⋅3=28+84 are correct since the Fano plane has 35 − 7 = 28 35−7=28 triangles. The only tweak: the line+point split is canonical from incidence alone, but the “sum” notation 𝑎 + 𝑏 a+b etc. is coordinatization-dependent language for that canonical split.",
          "structural_analysis": "This is genuinely structural: it produces an intrinsic two-type stratification of the 112 objects ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p) into “ 𝑝 p is the unique off-line complement point” versus “ 𝑝 p lies on the unique complement line,” giving a forced 28 / 84 28/84 partition. That’s not a surface coincidence; it’s a theorem about how triangles sit inside 𝑃 𝐺 ( 2 , 2 ) PG(2,2), and it is readily formalizable (coordinate-free statement: for each triangle 𝑇 T, 𝑇 𝑐 T c contains a unique line 𝐿 ( 𝑇 ) L(T), and the remaining point 𝑠 ( 𝑇 ) = 𝑇 𝑐 ∖ 𝐿 ( 𝑇 ) s(T)=T c ∖L(T)).",
          "naturalness_assessment": "High. Once the micro-chakras are defined as ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p) with 𝑝 ∈ 𝑇 𝑐 p∈T c , the refinement into 1 + 3 1+3 per triangle is essentially “of course”: 4 4 points in 𝑃 𝐺 ( 2 , 2 ) PG(2,2) can contain at most one line (any two lines intersect), and in this case they do contain one, leaving one distinguished residual point. The only non-inevitable part is calling the residual point a “sum-point” without first fixing a vector-space coordinatization.",
          "reasoning": "The claims are correct and the 28 + 84 28+84 split is forced by the Fano incidence geometry, yielding a clean canonical dichotomy inside the 112 construction. Rephrase the “sum” description in coordinate-free terms to make it axiomatic-grade and invariant under all automorphisms.",

          "mathematical_verification": "The claim is mathematically correct. In the Fano plane with 7 points and 7 lines, for any triangle T = {a,b,c}, its complement Tc consists of 4 points. Under the group law of F₂³, we have {a+b, b+c, c+a, a+b+c} as the complement. The first three points are indeed collinear (forming the \"opposite line\" to triangle T), while a+b+c is the unique fourth point. The arithmetic 112 = 28×4 = 28×(3+1) = 28+84 follows directly.",
          "structural_analysis": "This is a deep structural connection. The split isn't arbitrary - it's forced by the projective geometry and group structure. Every Fano triangle has a unique \"opposite line\" (its polar line under the polarity induced by the triangle), and the remaining point is the sum of all three triangle vertices. This 3+1 decomposition is canonical and reveals the inherent duality between triangles and their complements in PG(2,2).",
          "naturalness_assessment": "This feels genuinely discovered rather than constructed. The decomposition arises naturally from the incidence structure - given any triangle, there's only one way to complete it to a line (add the \"sum point\"), and the remaining points must form another line. This is an inevitable consequence of the Fano plane's structure, not a coincidental numerical match.",
          "reasoning": "This insight reveals a fundamental structural property of the Fano plane that naturally induces a 28+84 partition of the 112 chakras. The mathematical necessity of the 3+1 split for each triangle's complement, combined with the clean interpretation of the \"sum-point\" s(T), makes this a compelling connection between projective geometry and the yogic system.",
