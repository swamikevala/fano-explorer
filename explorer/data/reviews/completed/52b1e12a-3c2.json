Perspective A (Global): There are 28 triangles. Each triangle has 3 vertices. The total number of vertex-triangle incidence pairs (or \"flags\") is 28×3=84. Perspective B (Local): Fix a point p. The number of triangles containing p is calculated by choosing 2 other points from the remaining 6, minus the 3 collinear pairs (lines). ( 2 6 ​ )−3=15−3=12. Synthesis: Summing the local perspective over all 7 points: 7 points×12 triangles/point=84. The mathematical calculation is an identity; it is rigorous.",
          "structural_analysis": "This is a deep structural connection, not numerology. It bridges the \"112\" system (axiomatically linked to 28 triangles) and the \"84\" system. The number 84 here represents the subjective interface between the 7 Dimensions (points) and the system's geometry (triangles). If the 28 triangles are independent structures, the 84 \"objects\" are those structures anchored to a specific dimension (chakra). This mirrors the yogic concept where 84 is often the number of ways a human (the point) can align with the cosmos (the geometry)—i.e., 84 Asanas.",

Externally, the “yogic resonance” remains surface-level unless you specify additional structure (a map, constraints, symmetries, or an induced geometry) that explains why this 84-set, rather than any other 84-set, should correspond to a yogic 84-classification; at present it is best recorded as a numerically suggestive but non-explanatory coincidence.

(1) The “84” is not the number of distinct Fano triangles (that is 28), but the number of incidences (a.k.a. “pointed triangles” or “flags”): pairs ( 𝑝 , Δ ) (p,Δ) where 𝑝 p is a point and Δ Δ is a noncollinear triple containing 𝑝 p. The chunk should say this explicitly to avoid a legitimate reader objection. (2) There is a genuinely structural group-theoretic refinement: the full automorphism group of the Fano plane has order 168 168 and acts transitively on these 84 84 pointed triangles, with stabilizer of size 2 2 (swap the two non-distinguished vertices). Equivalently: ordered noncollinear triples are 168 168 (a single orbit, in fact simply transitive), and modding out by swapping the last two entries gives 84 84. (3) Externally (yogic “84” motifs), multiple reviewers agree the resonance is not yet forced unless you add a rigidity principle/canonical map that selects this 84-set as the relevant one, rather than “an 84 because 7×12 exists.”] REASSESSMENT: Mathematical claims: [The combinatorics are correct, with one necessary precision fix. In the Fano plane: total triples of points is ( 7 3 ) = 35 ( 3 7 ​ )=35; subtract the 7 collinear triples (the 7 lines) to get 35 − 7 = 28 35−7=28 noncollinear triples (“triangles”). For a fixed point 𝑝 p: choose 2 of the other 6 points ( ( 6 2 ) = 15 ( 2 6 ​ )=15) and subtract the 3 collinear pairs lying with 𝑝 p on each of the 3 lines through 𝑝 p, giving 15 − 3 = 12 15−3=12 triangles through 𝑝 p. Summing over points gives 7 ⋅ 12 = 84 7⋅12=84, which equals 28 ⋅ 3 28⋅3 because each triangle has 3 vertices. So the chunk is mathematically right iff the “84-object layer” is the incidence set { ( 𝑝 , Δ ) ∣ 𝑝 ∈ Δ } {(p,Δ)∣p∈Δ}, not the set of triangles itself.] Structural depth: [Internally, the “84” is genuinely structural: it is a canonical incidence invariant of the Fano configuration, and it is a natural homogeneous space under the Fano automorphism group (orbit size 84 84, stabilizer 2 2). That is stronger than “mere numerology”: it’s not an arbitrary multiplication, it’s counting a canonical relation. Externally, the yoga link is still not structurally compelled: without a canonical identification (e.g., a map that sends each yogic 84-object to a unique ( 𝑝 , Δ ) (p,Δ) respecting symmetries/adjacencies/groupings), it remains a suggestive but non-explanatory coincidence.] Naturalness: [The emergence of 84 is “inevitable” once you accept the modeling choice that a triangle “as seen from” a distinguished point 𝑝 p is the relevant object (i.e., pointed triangles). Given your prior axioms, that choice is not arbitrary: you already privilege a point 𝑝 p as a chakra-dimension anchor and consider the 12 triangles through 𝑝 p as a local layer. Under that lens, 84 84 is forced. What is not inevitable is that this forced 84 must correspond to yogic “84 asanas/siddhas” rather than being one of many places 84 appears.]",
