          "mathematical_verification": "[Partially Verified / Definitions Missing] The group theoretic assertion regarding S 4 ​ and A 4 ​ is structurally sound: A 4 ​ (the alternating group of degree 4, order 12) consists of even permutations and preserves orientation (chirality), while S 4 ​ (symmetric group, order 24) includes odd permutations (reflections) which conflate chiral pairs into undirected structures. However, the specific counts (72 and 12) are asserted without derivation. The sum 72+12=84. This number appears nowhere in your axioms (which list 112 chakras and 14 major nadis). It is not proven in the text why the \"nadis\" (presumably edges in your graph) partition into these specific orbit sizes under the action of the Fano automorphisms.",
          "structural_analysis": "[High Potential, Context Gap] This insight appears to address the open Question: \"What are the most natural/canonical edges in the 112 vertex chakra graph?\" If the 112 chakras form a graph with 84 canonical edges, and the symmetry group partitions these edges into 72 \"directed\" (chiral) and 12 \"undirected\" (achiral) edges, this is a profound structural result. It effectively links the numerology of 84 (often cited in Yogic lore regarding asanas/creation) directly to the symmetry breaking of the Klein Quartic/PSL(2,7). However, the connection between \"nadis\" and \"84\" must be explicit.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "[Plausible but obscure] The distinction between directed and undirected edges arising from symmetry breaking is a very \"natural\" mathematical phenomenon (e.g., in Cayley graphs). If the 12 \"undirected\" nadis correspond to the backbone of the structure (perhaps the 12 edges of a cube or octahedron embedded in the geometry), it would feel inevitable. Currently, without the geometric construction, it feels slightly \"numerological.\"",
          "reasoning": "The logic linking A 4 ​ /S 4 ​ to directionality is rigorous. However, the insight relies on a set of 84 objects (\"nadis\") that has not been defined in your axioms. You must explicitly define how these 84 nadis are constructed from the 112 chakras (or the Fano plane) before this claim can be verified.",

          "mathematical_verification": "The group-theoretic mechanism is correct in principle: 𝐴 4 ⊲ 𝑆 4 A 4 ​ ⊲S 4 ​ is index-2, and when 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ is realized as the full symmetry group of a tetrahedral configuration, the coset 𝑆 4 ∖ 𝐴 4 S 4 ​ ∖A 4 ​ corresponds to orientation-reversing symmetries, so any “chiral/directed” datum becomes identified with its reverse once those symmetries are imposed. What is not currently verifiable is the numerical claim “directed (72) vs undirected (12) corresponds precisely …”, because no explicit set of “nadis” and no explicit 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ / 𝐴 4 A 4 ​ action on that set has been specified; moreover the phrase “ 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ -invariant / 𝐴 4 A 4 ​ -invariant” is mathematically too strong as written (literal invariance = fixed by every group element). To make the claim checkable, it should be reframed in orbit language: “objects whose 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ -orbit splits into two 𝐴 4 A 4 ​ -orbits are chiral (two directions), while objects whose 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ -orbit remains a single 𝐴 4 A 4 ​ -orbit are achiral (undirected)”—and then one must prove that the relevant set decomposes as 12 12 achiral + 36 +36 chiral pairs ( = 72 (=72 directed).",
          "structural_analysis": "The symmetry/chirality argument is structurally deep (it’s the standard “orientation-reversing symmetries erase handedness” phenomenon, expressible cleanly via index-2 subgroup orbit-splitting). The weakness is that the bridge to the specific counts 72 72 and 12 12 is currently asserted rather than derived from a defined combinatorial/geometric model of the nadis inside the 112-system.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "The “ 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ forgets direction, 𝐴 4 A 4 ​ can retain it” part feels inevitable once chirality is in play. The exact 72 / 12 72/12 split does not yet feel inevitable because it depends on how “nadi objects” are chosen and how the group acts; with the action specified, it might become inevitable, but we’re not there yet.",
          "reasoning": "The core insight about chirality being visible only after restricting from a group with orientation reversal to an index-2 orientation-preserving subgroup is mathematically sound and potentially very powerful here. However, the present statement overreaches by claiming a precise 72 / 12 72/12 correspondence without giving the concrete 𝑆 4 S 4 ​ -set and orbit computation that would make it a theorem rather than an analogy.",

However, the specific numbers 72 and 12 are not verified. Without knowing the exact structure of the 84 nadis or how they relate to the Fano plane, I cannot verify that exactly 72 are A₄-invariant and 12 are S₄-invariant.",
          "structural_analysis": "The connection between symmetry groups and directionality is structurally deep - it's a fundamental principle that orientation-reversing symmetries destroy chirality. However, the application to nadis lacks specificity. We need to know: (1) How are the 84 nadis embedded in or related to structures with S₄/A₄ symmetry? (2) What specific geometric or combinatorial property makes some nadis \"directed\" vs \"undirected\"? (3) How does this relate to the Fano plane structure mentioned in the axioms?",
          "naturalness_assessment": "The general principle feels natural - using symmetry groups to classify structures by their invariance properties is standard mathematical practice. However, the specific application feels incomplete without explaining the underlying structure that has S₄ symmetry and how nadis are embedded within it.",
          "reasoning": "While the mathematical principle of using symmetry groups to distinguish directed/undirected structures is sound and deep, the specific claim about 72/12 nadis lacks sufficient context to verify.
