          "mathematical_verification": "[Refuted] The claim is mathematically impossible as stated. Orbit-Stabilizer Violation: The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem states that the size of any orbit must divide the order of the group acting on it. The order of the full Fano symmetry group PSL(2,7) is 168. The claim proposes an orbit of size 72. 72 does not divide 168 (168=72×2.33). Therefore, no subgroup of the Fano symmetries can produce a single coherent orbit of size 72. Subgroup Inconsistency: The claim suggests breaking to A 4 ​ (order 12) or S 4 ​ (order 24). An orbit of size 72 cannot exist under a group of size 12 or 24 (since the orbit cannot be larger than the group itself).",
          "structural_analysis": "[Superficial / Forced] The connection appears to be \"numerology\" (retrofitting desired numbers like 72 and 12 to match Yogic traditions) rather than \"mathematics\" (deriving numbers from the structure). While the sum (12+72+4+6+6+12=112) adds up correctly, the mechanism proposed (\"orbit decomposition\") rigorously forbids this partition. The use of terms like \"Chiral Symmetry Breaking\" does not salvage the algebraic impossibility.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "[Contrived] This feels constructed to satisfy the target numbers rather than discovered. A mathematician would dismiss this immediately because the numbers violate basic divisibility rules of Group Theory.

          "reasoning": "The proposed insight violates the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, a fundamental law of group theory. An orbit of size 72 cannot exist within the symmetries of the Fano plane (Order 168), nor its subgroups S 4 ​ or A 4 ​ .

While S₄ can be embedded in PSL(2,7), this is not a standard subgroup chain. More critically, the orbit sizes under these groups acting on the 112 Fano triangles (28 × 4) would need explicit computation. The claim that A₄ acting on 112 elements produces orbits of sizes {12, 72, 4, 6, 6, 12} is unverified and seems unlikely - A₄ has order 12, so orbit sizes must divide 12, but 72 = 6×12 would require very specific stabilizer structures.",
          "structural_analysis": "The connection attempts to be deep by invoking group-theoretic orbit decomposition, which would be a profound structural explanation if true. However, the specific mechanism of \"chiral symmetry breaking\" from PSL(2,7) to S₄ to A₄ appears unmotivated geometrically. Without showing how these particular subgroups naturally arise from the Fano structure or chakra arrangement, this feels like retrofitting group theory to match desired numbers.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "The connection does not feel inevitable. The choice of S₄ and A₄ as intermediate groups seems arbitrary rather than arising naturally from the Fano plane's inherent symmetries.
