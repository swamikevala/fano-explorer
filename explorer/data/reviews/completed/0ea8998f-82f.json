Removing 𝐿 ∞ L ∞ ​ produces the affine plane 𝐴 𝐺 ( 2 , 2 ) AG(2,2) with 4 affine points and 6 affine lines.

This makes the count mathematically native: it’s the standard construction “incidence graph of a geometry,” and 𝐴 𝐺 ( 2 , 2 ) AG(2,2) is unique up to isomorphism, so the 10-vertex structure is likewise canonical up to isomorphism. The “which 𝐿 ∞ L ∞ ​ ?” arbitrariness dissolves because any choice yields an isomorphic affine patch; what is physically/interpretively meaningful is the symmetry-breaking act of choosing a horizon, not the identity of the chosen line. Finally, the order-2 miracle makes the insight feel discovered rather than engineered: in 𝑞 = 2 q=2, affine “lines” are 2-point objects, so the entire manifested plane collapses to the tetrahedral connectivity 𝐾 4 K 4 ​ , making 4 4 (sites), 6 6 (connections), and 10 10 (site+connection roles) a tight, inevitable package.]"
