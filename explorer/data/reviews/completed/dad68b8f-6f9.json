It is strictly defined as the graph of anti-flags of the Fano plane. An anti-flag is a pair (P,L) where P is a point and L is a line, and P is not on L. Since the Fano plane has 7 lines and each line contains 3 points (leaving 4 points not on that line), there are 7×4=28 anti-flags. The girth of the Coxeter graph is indeed 7. This means the smallest closed loop in the graph consists of 7 edges.",
          "structural_analysis": "Deep. This provides a rigorous topological mechanism for the reduction of the number 28 to the number 7. In the provided axioms, you established that 112 chakras relate to 28 'Fano Triangles' (or anti-flags). This chunk asserts that if these 28 states interact linearly (neighbor to neighbor), they cannot form a closed loop smaller than 7 steps. This connects the \"28\" of the structural complexity to the \"7\" of the temporal/cyclic experience (the octave).
