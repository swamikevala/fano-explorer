The calculation is rigorous and accurate based on finite geometry: Total Triplets: The number of ways to choose 3 points from the 7 points of the Fano plane is ( 3 7 ​ )= 3⋅2⋅1 7⋅6⋅5 ​ =35. Triangles vs. Lines: In the Fano plane, a \"triangle\" is defined as a non-collinear triple. There are exactly 7 lines (collinear triples). Therefore, the number of triangles is 35−7=28. Anti-Incidence: For any triangle T (size 3), the number of points x in the plane (P) such that x∈ / T is ∣P∣−∣T∣=7−3=4. Total Count: The size of the set {(x,T):x∈ / T} is 28×4=112.",
          "structural_analysis": "Deep. This is not merely numerology; it is a structural invariant of the PG(2,2) geometry. Completeness: It utilizes the entire set of non-collinear structures in the plane. Duality: This formulation mathematically formalizes the first \"Seed Aphorism\" provided in the context. It moves the definition of the 112 from a static list to a relational dynamic (point vs. structure). Semantic Mapping: The mapping of \"non-incidence\" (x∈ / T) to \"witnessing\" (Sakshi) is a topologically sound metaphor. In topology and geometry, the \"excluded point\" is often the perspectival center from which a projection or observation is defined.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "Inevitable. This construction feels discovered rather than engineered. Once you accept the Fano plane as the base grid (Axiom 1), the number 112 is not an arbitrary target to be hit, but a naturally emerging count of valid perspective points relative to stable triangular structures. A mathematician would regard the set of anti-incidences as a fundamental object of study for this plane.",

For each triangle 𝑇 T there are 7 − 3 = 4 7−3=4 points 𝑥 x with 𝑥 ∉ 𝑇 x∈ / T, so ∣ { ( 𝑥 , 𝑇 ) : 𝑥 ∉ 𝑇 } ∣ = 28 ⋅ 4 = 112 ∣{(x,T):x∈ / T}∣=28⋅4=112. Equivalently, this is the edge set of the point–triangle anti-incidence bipartite graph: each point 𝑥 x is paired with exactly 28 − 12 = 16 28−12=16 triangles not containing it (since each point lies in 12 12 triangles), giving the canonical 7 × 16 7×16 split. (If “triangle” were taken to include collinear triples/lines, the count would be 35 ⋅ 4 = 140 35⋅4=140, so the non-collinear meaning matters.)",
          "structural_analysis": "This is not surface numerology: it identifies the “112” as a specific, rigid combinatorial object—the complement of the point–triangle incidence relation—so it can be stated as a clean lemma and used downstream (degrees 16 16 and 4 4, two natural projections onto “witness point” and “observed triangle,” symmetry action, etc.). The “Sakshi” language is an interpretive layer, but it is anchored to an actual structural feature: 𝑥 x is literally “outside” the observed triple 𝑇 T.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "Given the seed axiom “28 triangles adjoined with each of the four remaining points,” rewriting that as ( 𝑥 , 𝑇 ) (x,T) with 𝑥 ∉ 𝑇 x∈ / T is essentially the most inevitable, coordinate-free formulation available. The specific metaphysical reading (“witness stands outside”) is not mathematically forced, but it is a natural semantic reflection of the anti-incidence relation rather than an arbitrary story pasted onto a number.",
