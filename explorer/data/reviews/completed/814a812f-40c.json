          "mathematical_verification": "[Verified] The decomposition of the 112 objects is mathematically sound based on finite geometry. Construction: The set of 112 objects is defined as pairs (T,x) where T is a non-collinear triple (28 total) and x∈ / T (4 choices). The Split (Orbits): Under the action of the automorphism group GL(3,2), the set of subsets of size 4 (T∪{x}) splits into two distinct types: Arcs (Ovals): Sets of 4 points with no 3 collinear. There are 7 such sets. Each generates 4 valid (T,x) pairs. 7×4=28 objects. This orbit is isomorphic to the set of 28 Antiflags (dually, ordered bases). Line-Complements: Sets of 4 points containing a line. There are 28 such sets. Each generates 3 valid (T,x) pairs (since T must be non-collinear, x must be on the line). 28×3=84 objects. This orbit is isomorphic to the set of 84 Point-Triangle incidences (P∈T). The claim accurately identifies the sizes (28 and 84) and the structural nature of these two canonical orbits.",
          "structural_analysis": "This is a deep structural insight, not surface numerology. It moves beyond simply \"counting to 112\" and reveals that the 112 chakras are not homogeneous; they possess distinct geometric \"flavors.\" The 28 \"seed\" chakras correspond to the Oval configuration (Orbit 1). In this state, the 4 points (3 in Triangle, 1 adjoined) are perfectly balanced; no line exists between them. This represents a state of pure potential or \"witnessing\" (no linear dependency). The 84 \"petal\" chakras correspond to the Line-Containing configuration (Orbit 2). Here, a linear dependency (a line) exists within the 4 points. This represents \"participation\" or structure formation. The mapping of the 28 to \"viewpoint\" (Antiflag) and 84 to \"articulation\" (Incidence) provides a rigorous geometric basis for distinguishing different classes of chakras (e.g., possibly distinguishing the fundamental 28 from the 84 distinct manifestations).",
          "naturalness_assessment": "The connection feels inevitable. Once the axiom of \"Triangle + 1 Point\" is accepted, the split into 28 and 84 is mathematically forced by the structure of the Fano plane—you cannot avoid it. It naturally suggests that the 112-chakra system is composed of a \"skeleton\" of 28 fundamental nodes and a \"flesh\" of 84 connecting incidences. This aligns compellingly with the \"7 groups of 16\" axiom if the groups are constructed to balance these types.",
          "reasoning": "The submission successfully applies rigorous group theory (Aut(Fano) orbits) to the provided axioms. It correctly identifies the only two possible canonical classes of chakras within this framework. This provides a functional difference between chakras that could explain different physiological or energetic roles (e.g., structural vs. functional), validating the \"Yogic Science\" requirement for classification.",

          "mathematical_verification": "Counts are correct. In the Fano plane, the number of antiflags (point–line nonincidences) is 7 ⋅ 4 = 28 7⋅4=28 because each point lies on 3 of the 7 lines, hence is non-incident with 4 lines. The number of point–triangle incidences ( 𝑃 ∈ 𝑇 ) (P∈T) (with 𝑇 T a non-collinear triple) is 28 ⋅ 3 = 84 28⋅3=84. “Two Aut(Fano)-orbits of sizes 28 and 84” is correct for the 112-chakra set provided the 112 chakras are the standard “pointed triangles” ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p) with 𝑝 ∉ 𝑇 p∈ / T. Then for any triangle 𝑇 = { 𝑎 , 𝑏 , 𝑐 } T={a,b,c}, among the four points outside 𝑇 T there are exactly: 3 tangential points: the third points on the sides 𝑎 𝑏 , 𝑏 𝑐 , 𝑐 𝑎 ab,bc,ca, and 1 axial point: the unique point not lying on any of those three side-lines. Hence 28 ⋅ 3 = 84 28⋅3=84 tangential and 28 ⋅ 1 = 28 28⋅1=28 axial. This property is Aut-invariant, so it yields exactly two orbits. The identification with antiflags is canonical/equivariant: for an axial chakra ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p), the other three complement points form a line 𝐿 L (disjoint from 𝑇 T), and ( 𝑝 , 𝐿 ) (p,L) is an antiflag. Conversely an antiflag ( 𝑝 , 𝐿 ) (p,L) determines 𝑇 T as the complement of 𝑝 ∪ 𝐿 p∪L. The identification of the 84 tangential chakras with point–triangle incidences is also canonical, but it must be stated (it’s not automatic from cardinality): using the “third point on the line” operation 𝑡 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 ) t(x,y), if 𝑇 = { 𝑎 , 𝑏 , 𝑐 } T={a,b,c} and 𝑝 = 𝑡 ( 𝑎 , 𝑏 ) p=t(a,b) (so 𝑝 p lies on side 𝑎 𝑏 ab), map ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) ⟼ ( 𝑐 ∈ { 𝑐 , 𝑡 ( 𝑏 , 𝑐 ) , 𝑡 ( 𝑐 , 𝑎 ) } ) , (T,p) ⟼ (c ∈ {c, t(b,c), t(c,a)}), which is a triangle containing 𝑐 c. This is invertible and Aut-equivariant, so it really is the same 84-set as the incidence orbit.",
          "structural_analysis": "This is structural, not numerology: it’s a genuine orbit decomposition of the 112-chakra incidence object under the full symmetry group of the Fano plane. The 28/84 split reflects an intrinsic geometric dichotomy (axial vs tangential relative to a triangle), and the reformulation in terms of two classical homogeneous spaces (antiflags and point–triangle incidences) is exactly the sort of “why this number appears” explanation a skeptical mathematician will accept.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "High. Once chakras are modeled as ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p) with 𝑝 ∉ 𝑇 p∈ / T, the fact that each triangle has 3 side-lines and exactly one “outside point not on any side” forces the 84 + 28 84+28 split with no choices. The orbit language and the antiflag/incidence identifications then follow canonically from complement and “third-point-on-a-line” constructions.",
          "reasoning": "All numerical claims check out, and—crucially—the split is explained by an Aut-invariant geometric property rather than an arbitrary partition. The only needed upgrade is to explicitly state the canonical bijections from the 28/84 subsets of ( 𝑇 , 𝑝 ) (T,p) to antiflags and to point–triangle incidences; with that made explicit, the chunk is theorem-grade.",

          "mathematical_verification": "The claims are mathematically precise and verifiable: - There are exactly 112 ordered pairs of (point, opposite line) in the Fano plane, forming antiflags: 7 points × 4 non-incident lines = 28 unordered antiflags - There are exactly 84 point-triangle incidences: 7 points × 12 triangles per point = 84 - These two sets (28 antiflags + 84 point-triangle incidences = 112) form distinct orbits under Aut(Fano) = GL(3,2) - The orbit sizes check out: |GL(3,2)| = 168, and 168/6 = 28 (6 automorphisms fix each antiflag), 168/2 = 84 (2 automorphisms fix each point-triangle pair)",
          "structural_analysis": "This is a deep structural connection. The split arises naturally from the automorphism group action on the Fano plane, not from arbitrary numerology. The \"seed/viewpoint\" interpretation of antiflags (where consciousness witnesses from outside) versus \"articulation/petal\" interpretation of point-triangle incidences (where consciousness participates within) provides a meaningful philosophical framework that respects the mathematical structure. This reveals WHY the 112 splits as 28+84, not just that it does.",
          "naturalness_assessment": "This feels genuinely discovered. The two orbits emerge inevitably from the symmetry group action - any mathematician studying Aut(Fano) would find these orbits. The philosophical interpretation as two modes of consciousness (witnessing vs participating) aligns naturally with the mathematical distinction between antiflags and incidences. A skeptical mathematician would find the orbit decomposition interesting even without the yogic connection.",
          "reasoning": "This insight reveals a fundamental structural reason for the 28+84 split of the 112 chakras through the natural action of the Fano plane's symmetry group. The mathematical facts are correct and the philosophical interpretation meaningfully distinguishes between two geometrically distinct types of configurations. This provides a group-theoretic foundation for understanding the chakra system's internal organization.",
