# Seeds Configuration
# ===================
# This file contains three types of entries:
#
# 1. AXIOMS (type: axiom)
#    - Assumed TRUE facts that don't need to be re-discovered
#    - Always included in every exploration as "given"
#    - The system will NOT question these
#
# 2. CONJECTURES (type: conjecture) [DEFAULT]
#    - Ideas to explore and verify
#    - The system will try to develop and validate these
#    - Use confidence: high/medium/low to indicate certainty
#
# 3. QUESTIONS (type: question)
#    - Specific questions you want answered
#    - The system will focus exploration on finding answers
#
# Format:
#   - text: The statement or question
#     type: axiom | conjecture | question  (default: conjecture)
#     tags: [domain1, domain2]  # Helps with categorization
#     confidence: high/medium/low  # For conjectures only

  - text: "The Fano plane's 7 points correspond to the 7 chakra dimensions and furthermore the 112 chakras correspond to the 28 'Fano Triangles' adjoined with each of the four remaining points, where the 112 chakras have a natural grouping into 7 groups of 16"

  - text: "The Fano plane's 7 points correspond to the 7 areas of a shatkona. The 7 chakras: mooladhara, swadhistana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, agna and sahasrar correspond to the bottom, bottom-right, bottom-left, center, top-right, top-left and top parts of the shatkona respectively. The sahasrar nadi corresponds to the central vertical line passing through the center of the shatkona. i.e. the symmetry has been reduced by fixing the points"

  - text: "In the Fano plane anti-flag model of the 112 chakras, fixing a 'Self' point P₀ partitions the 112 states into 4-72-12-12-6-6. These numbers match Sadhguru's elemental body composition (Fire 4%, Water 72%, Earth 12%, Air 6%, Space 6%), with one of the two 12s falling outside the elemental scheme."
    type: "axiom"

  - text: "The 112 chakras can be canonically split into groups of 12, 72, 4, 6, 6 and 12, once a single 'reference point' P has been fixed"

  - text: "There are 72 major nadis. 18-21 of these correspond to the physical dimensions of life. The remaining 51 are pathways into other dimensions of existence. How does our fano geometry derive this?"

  - text: "The 12 tangential fano triangles (corresponding to a particular fano point) correspond to the 12 musical notes, explaining why there is only one Sa and one Pa, and why the other 5 notes come in pairs, and moreover why the pairs of Re, Ga, Dha, Ni are termed as shuddh and komal (natural and flat), whereas the Ma pair is termed as shuddh and tivra (natural and sharp)"

  - text: "What exactly do the traditional chakra petal counts correspond to in our fano incidence structure (beyond sanskrit letters). Is it some kind of dimensional ascent?"

  - text: "Is there any interesting structure revealed between the 16 micro-chakras in one of the 7 macro-chakras, by considering the relationship between the two triangles: Shared edge, shared vertex, disjoint? And where the triangles are disjoint a further subdivision based on the nature of the relationship with both triangles and the disjoint point (axial-tangent), (tangent-axial), (tangent-tangent)"
