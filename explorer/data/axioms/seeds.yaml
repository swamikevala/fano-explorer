# Seeds Configuration
# ===================
# This file contains three types of entries:
#
# 1. AXIOMS (type: axiom)
#    - Assumed TRUE facts that don't need to be re-discovered
#    - Always included in every exploration as "given"
#    - The system will NOT question these
#
# 2. CONJECTURES (type: conjecture) [DEFAULT]
#    - Ideas to explore and verify
#    - The system will try to develop and validate these
#    - Use confidence: high/medium/low to indicate certainty
#
# 3. QUESTIONS (type: question)
#    - Specific questions you want answered
#    - The system will focus exploration on finding answers
#
# Format:
#   - text: The statement or question
#     type: axiom | conjecture | question  (default: conjecture)
#     tags: [domain1, domain2]  # Helps with categorization

- text: The Fano plane's 7 points correspond to the 7 chakra dimensions and furthermore the 112 chakras correspond to the
    28 'Fano Triangles' adjoined with each of the four remaining points, where the 112 chakras have a natural grouping into
    7 groups of 16

  notes: This is the basis for understanding the geometry of the entire energy system
- text: 'The Fano plane''s 7 points correspond to the 7 areas of a shatkona. The 7 chakras: mooladhara, swadhistana, manipura,
    anahata, vishuddhi, agna and sahasrar correspond to the bottom, bottom-right, bottom-left, center, top-right, top-left
    and top parts of the shatkona respectively. The sahasrar nadi corresponds to the central vertical line passing through
    the center of the shatkona. i.e. the symmetry has been reduced by fixing the points'

  notes: This is the order in which the energy travels
- text: In the Fano plane anti-flag model of the 112 chakras, fixing a 'Self' point P₀ partitions the 112 states into 4-72-12-12-6-6.
    These numbers match Sadhguru's elemental body composition (Fire 4%, Water 72%, Earth 12%, Air 6%, Space 6%), with one
    of the two 12s falling outside the elemental scheme.
  id: seed-002
  type: axiom
- text: The 112 chakras can be canonically split into groups of 12, 72, 4, 6, 6 and 12, once a single 'reference point' P
    has been fixed

  notes: This is the basis for understanding the five elements
- text: There are 72 major nadis. 18-21 of these correspond to the physical dimensions of life. The remaining 51 are pathways
    into other dimensions of existence. How does our fano geometry derive this?

- text: The 12 tangential fano triangles (corresponding to a particular fano point) correspond to the 12 musical notes, explaining
    why there is only one Sa and one Pa, and why the other 5 notes come in pairs, and moreover why the pairs of Re, Ga, Dha,
    Ni are termed as shuddh and komal (natural and flat), whereas the Ma pair is termed as shuddh and tivra (natural and sharp)

    the edges directed or not?

- text: What exactly do the traditional chakra petal counts correspond to in our fano incidence structure (beyond sanskrit
    letters). Is it some kind of dimensional ascent?
  id: seed-007
  type: question
- text: Is there a natural split of the 112 chakras into groups of 12, 72, 4, 6, 6, 12. If so, how is this split derived,
    and what does it correspond to?

- text: 'Is there any interesting structure revealed between the 16 micro-chakras in one of the 7 macro-chakras, by considering
    the relationship between the two triangles: Shared edge, shared vertex, disjoint? And where the triangles are disjoint
    a further subdivision based on the nature of the relationship with both triangles and the disjoint point (axial-tangent),
    (tangent-axial), (tangent-tangent)'

    structure?
  id: seed-010

- text: Do the Sanskrit names of the 14 major nadis encode information about the mathematical structure corresponding to that
    nadi, based on the phonemes in their names and the petal-letter, chakra-bija-mantra correspondence?
  id: seed-011
  type: question
- text: how are the 113th and 114th 'out-of-the-body' chakras most naturally modelled with the existing mathematical framework
    for the 112 'in-the-body' chakras?
  id: seed-012
  type: question
- text: what is the nature of the 4 special chakras out of the 112 and how do they relate to the other chakras? Is there any
    connection to the numbers 108 and 112 in this respect?

- text: Fano arithmetic uses XOR logical operator. What is the relationship with binary addition and binary multiplication.
    Can the fano structure give insights on the nature of the relationship between additiona and multiplication via the XOR
    operator?

    any relationship between the 4 fire elements: jataragni, chitagni, bhutagni, sarvagni and the 4 elemental ''fire'' chakras?'

- text: Our fano geometry relies on symmetry breaking by defining a reference point or line. Once this one point (or line)
    has been defined, is there a natural second point, and a natural sequence of all 7 points?

- text: The 7 chakras correspond to the 7 musical swaras (S,R,G,M,P,D,N) - but which chakra corresponds to which swara? Ma
    seems to naturally correspond to the distinguished point/line. In music R,G,D,N all come in pairs, and S, P come as singletones
    which are more fundamental in nature. Which chakra point/lines do they correspond to (once symmetry has been broken byb
    choosing Ma)

- text: 'How does the following statement relate to, and of what significance is it to our exploration: ''affine geometry
    emerges as the geometry obtained from projective geometry by selecting a line and considering only those transformations
    that map that line to itself; the line can then be thought of as lying ‘at infinity’ and safely ignored.'''
