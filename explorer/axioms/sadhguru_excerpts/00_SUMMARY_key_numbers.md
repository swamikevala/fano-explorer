## Core Numbers

| Number | Significance | Relationships |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **0** | Shoonya, emptiness, zero, the linga | Foundation of mathematics, "that which is not" |
| **1** | Unity, ellipsoid, first form | All numbers are iterations of 1 |
| **3** | First manifestation (AUM: a-u-m) | Trinity precedes all other creation |
| **4** | Elements (excluding space), types of agni | 4% fire in body; primes 1,2,3,5 for music |
| **5** | Pancha Bhutas, Pancha Pranas | 5 elements; 5 pranas for ordinary life |
| **6** | Akash %, Air % | 6% space + 6% air in body |
| **7** | Dimensions, notes, chakras, colors | 7 dimensions contain 112 chakras |
| **10** | Additional pranas for occult | 5 + 10 = 15 pranas for advanced practice |
| **12** | Earth % in body | 12% earth; 12 moons per year |
| **21** | Categories with footprints, asanas | 21 = 3 × 7; universes still influencing us |
| **22** | Shrutis (micro-tones) | Between 7 notes; based on primes 1,2,3,5 |
| **72** | Water % in body and planet | 72% water in body mirrors planet |
| **84** | Current cosmic cycle, pranas | 84 asanas; 84 years = 1008 moons; 84 pranas |
| **112** | Physical chakras / max physical creations | 112 = 7 × 16; clockwise/anticlockwise pairs |
| **114** | Total chakras / eternal creation | 112 + 2 outside body; 114th = infinity symbol |
| **1008** | Full moons in 84 years, days of practice | 84 × 12 = 1008; mastery through practice |
| **72,000** | Nadis (energy channels) | Meet at 114 points |

## Key Relationships

### Five Elements Body Composition
```
Water:  72%  (largest, mirrors planet)
Earth:  12%  (foundation, stability)
Air:     6%  (most accessible for mastery)
Fire:    4%  (smallest but most transformative)
Space:   6%  (etheric, mystical dimension)
-----------
Total: 100%

Water + Earth = 84%  ← Same as current cosmic cycle number!
Air + Fire = 10%
Space = 6%
```

### Creation Sequence
```
∞ (Anant/Infinite) 
    → 0 (Shoonya/Zero) 
    → 3 (First manifestation/AUM)
    → Physical forms through cyclical movement
```

### The 7-112 Structure
```
7 dimensions × 16 = 112 physical chakras
+ 2 non-physical chakras = 114 total
```

### Musical Structure  
```
7 notes (swaras) ↔ 7 chakras ↔ 7 colors
22 shrutis between the 7 notes
Ratios based on primes: 1, 2, 3, 5 (4 elements minus space)
```

### Cosmic Cycles
```
84 cycles completed (current)
112 total physical cycles possible
113 = semi-physical
114 = non-physical eternal
21 cycles still have active footprints
```

### The 84 Pranas
```
84 total pranas in atmospheric womb
 5 pancha pranas (sufficient for ordinary life)
10 additional (for occult practices)
69 remaining (too subtle to access)

1008 days of practice = mastery over prana
```

### Four Types of Agni (Fire)
```
1. Jatharagni - Digestive/reproductive fire
2. Chitagni   - Fire of intelligence
3. Bhutagni   - Elemental fire
4. Sarvagni   - Universal fire (cool fire, beyond elements)

Progression: Body → Mind → Elements → Beyond
```

### Fundamental Duality
```
0 and 1 = all of mathematics
Shiva (vacuum/0) + Shakti (force/1) = creation
Clockwise + anticlockwise = all 112 chakras
Centripetal + centrifugal = all cycles
```

## Primes and Elements

| Prime | Element |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | (Unity) |
| 2 | Earth |
| 3 | Water |
| 5 | Fire |
| — | Air |
| — | Space (Akash) - transcends |

The 22 shrutis are built from ratios using primes 1, 2, 3, 5—representing four elements, with space (akash) being beyond the musical structure.

## Questions for Exploration

1. Why does 3 precede 1 in manifestation?
2. What is the relationship between 7 × 16 = 112 and the Fano plane (7 points, 7 lines)?
3. How do 22 shrutis relate to the 21 categories?
4. Why 72,000 nadis? (72 × 1000; 72 also appears as % water in body)
5. What is the mathematical structure of the infinity symbol (∞) as the 114th chakra?
6. How does the prime structure (1,2,3,5) encode the elements?
7. Why 84 as the current cycle? (84 = 4 × 21 = 12 × 7 = 2² × 3 × 7)
8. **Is it coincidence that Water + Earth = 84% matches the 84 cosmic cycles?**
9. **Why 84 pranas match 84 asanas match 84 cycles?**
10. **How do the 4 types of agni relate to the 4 elements (excluding space)?**
11. **What is the relationship between 1008 days of practice and 1008 moons in 84 years?**
12. **Why does space (akash) = 6% while air = 6%? Is this symmetry significant?**
