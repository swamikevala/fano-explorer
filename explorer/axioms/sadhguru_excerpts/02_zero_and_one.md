# The Play of Zero and One

**Context:** On the nature of mathematics and the invention of zero

The zero was given to you by an Indian mystic, not by a mathematician. The zero was given to the world not by a mathematics professor but by an Indian mystic. So when they were struggling with numbers, "What to do, we can't count beyond ten, only fingers we can count, beyond that how to go," he just said, "This is the solution." All he has drawn is a linga and said, "This is the way to go if you want to go beyond. You can play with it as much as you want but if you pull it down everything becomes one."

See, it doesn't become two, I want you to get this. If you take 20 and take off the zero you think it becomes two but actually it becomes one. What you are trying to write from one to hundred is only doing one plus one plus one plus one. You are using different symbols to represent these additions, that's all you're doing. Ultimately the only value is one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, billion—there is no entity for two billion. It is one billion and one billion, that's all.

There is one, there is ten, there is hundred, there is thousand—all this is just a play between one and zero. The rest is only a symbolic representation of this. The only play of the whole mathematics is between one and zero. And this is not mathematics, this is the nature of the existence and that's the reason why mathematics has become the tool to describe existence. No other tool has managed to describe existence to the extent mathematics has done. Language has not gone as far as mathematics. This is simply because mathematics is simply a whole game between one and zero.

Shiva as an ellipsoid, the primordial form, and Shiva as a phallic symbol—one and zero. The whole game is just that and all your mathematics has come from this fundamental.

**Key Numbers:** 0, 1  
**Mathematical Insight:** All mathematics is the interplay between existence (1) and non-existence (0). The ellipsoid (linga) is 1, the empty circle is 0. Every number is simply a representation of repeated unity.
