# The 114 Chakras and 72,000 Nadis

**Source:** SG conversation with physicist  
**Context:** On the energy system of the body and its cosmic correspondence

In the body, the energy system, the basic bio-energy in the system which we refer to as prana, has 114 junction points, important meeting places. The nadis are 72,000 in number—they meet at 114 points in the body. 112 are within the physical body, two are outside the body.

This manifestation itself is a representation of the cosmic scape. So 112 are physical in nature. If one learns how to activate the other two, which are not in the physical body, one will experience continuous transcendence.

The way all the 112 chakras are functioning—there's always a counterpoint. One is going clockwise, another becomes anticlockwise. This is the way all the 112 chakras are functioning. There's always a counterpoint, one is going this way, one is going that way, which keeps the system going.

The 114th chakra is a manifestation which is not these counter cycles. It is a loop by itself—the shape of infinity (∞), the horizontal figure-8. This is the symbol for infinity in mathematics. So the 114th chakra goes like this, not in counter cycles. That's why when creation reaches the 114th manifestation it will be non-physical, but still manifest. That's infinite.

**Key Numbers:** 114, 112, 2, 72000, 7  
**Mathematical Insight:** 
- 112 = 7 × 16 (physical chakras, arranged in 7 dimensions)
- 72,000 nadis converge at 114 points
- The 114th is represented by the lemniscate (∞)
- Duality (clockwise/anticlockwise) governs 112; infinity transcends duality
