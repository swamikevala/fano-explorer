# The 84 Cosmic Cycles

**Source:** SG conversation with Dr. Bernard Carr and others  
**Context:** On cosmic cycles of creation and dissolution

We are in the 84th cycle. Creation happened, expanded to its limits, obliterated itself and again started over—this is the 84th time. And it will continue to happen till it reaches 112. After that, the creation will happen next time in a semi-physical condition, not in a physical condition. That will be 113. After that, it will happen in 114, a non-physical creation, a no-thing, which is right now un-manifest. A no-thing will manifest itself in the subtlest possible way, and this will live forever.

So 84 Big Bangs happened, 84 times Shiva roared till now. He will roar up to 112 times, after that he will not roar. He will step out. He will step out means, the nothingness itself will be a universe. It will not be physical existence. The 113th one will be semi-physical. 114 will be non-physical.

Based on this, we created 84 fundamental asanas. So the yogic system says if you get into these 84 asanas, your system will be ready to access the next dimension.

If you live for 84 years, you will witness 1008 full moons. If you witness 1008 full moons, even if you live an utterly unaware life, you get pushed to a different dimension.

Out of these 84 cycles, many have dissolved. Their bare, vague footprint is there, but they have dissolved. But 21 of them have a little larger footprint. Out of these 21, ten are almost non-physical. The remaining eleven are somewhat mildly physical, but the last four are reasonably physical. So we see this number 21 as an important process.

**Key Numbers:** 84, 112, 113, 114, 21, 1008  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- 84 cycles have occurred (current creation)
- 112 = maximum physical manifestations
- 113 = semi-physical
- 114 = non-physical eternal
- 21 cycles still have footprints (21 = 3 × 7)
- 84 years = 1008 full moons (84 × 12 = 1008)
- 84 fundamental asanas
