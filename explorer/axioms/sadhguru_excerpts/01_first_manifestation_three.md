# The First Manifestation is Always Three

**Source:** SG conversation with physicist  
**Context:** On the nature of creation from unmanifest to manifest

When it's un-manifest, it's nothing. But the first number is three—not one. It never happened as one, always it was three, whichever way you look at it. From whichever perspective you look at it, the first manifestation is always in the form of three.

When three happened, these three in combination created trillions—trillions and trillions of forms. Each one seemed to be absolutely unique in its own nature but everything is just consolidation of that which was not became that which *is*. The moment it became that which *is*, it has three dimensions in it.

So, *aaa*, *ooo*, *maa* (AUM) is the first manifestation of sound. Sound means material. The subtlest form of material existence is sound.

**Key Numbers:** 3 (first manifestation)  
**Mathematical Insight:** Creation never manifests as unity (1) but always as trinity (3). The number 3 precedes all other manifestation.
