# Akasha: Ether vs Empty Space

**Source:** Sadhguru on the Five Elements  
**Context:** On the distinction between akasha and empty space

---

Do not mistake akasha for empty space. It is ether. The word "ether" is not quite accurate but it is the closest translation. Ether is not space; it is a subtle dimension of existence.

**Space is kala or nonexistence. It is Shi-va – "that which is not." Akasha is "that which is."**

The word Kala means:
- Empty
- Darkness  
- Time
- Space

All these four things became somewhat manifest because it became a kala. So this is here as emptiness. But we call this infinite space. It is time which is unfolding to become space.

Fire is the element that is closest to akash or the ether. The akashic or etheric dimension becomes more accessible where there is fire. Fire makes akash or the ether more accessible.

Of all the elements that we are made of, akash is the one that is most transparent and fluid:
- The earth in my body and your body is fundamentally the same, but in terms of what your body contains and what mine contains, it is distinctly separate.
- The water within you and within me is separate – kept in different containers.
- But the air that we breathe cannot be separated. It is being exchanged all the time.
- The fire element of who we are is shared to an even larger extent.
- **The akashic element is absolutely shared. We are all in the same akash.**

If you enhance the akashic element in any atmosphere, a certain bonding happens between human beings. Around a fire, togetherness and communication are greatly enhanced, because where there is fire, the element of akash becomes dominant.

**Key Numbers:** 6% (akash in body), 5 (elements), 4 (meanings of Kala)  
**Mathematical Insight:**
- Akasha = 6% of body composition
- Akasha is the 5th element, transcending the other 4
- Kala has 4 meanings (empty, dark, time, space) unified in one concept
- Progression of sharing: Earth (separate) → Water (contained) → Air (exchanged) → Fire (shared) → Akash (unified)
- Fire bridges physical (4 elements) to etheric (akash)
