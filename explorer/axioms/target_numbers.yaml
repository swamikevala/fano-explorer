# Target Numbers to Decode
# 
# These are the specific numbers from Sadhguru's teachings that the
# exploration should attempt to explain mathematically. Each number
# or number set should feel INEVITABLE once the underlying structure
# is understood.

# Pancha Bhuta proportions in the body
pancha_bhuta:
  description: "Elemental composition of the human body"
  source: "Sadhguru excerpt on five elements"
  numbers:
    water: 72
    earth: 12
    fire: 4
    air: 6
    space: 6
  total: 100
  notes: |
    These should emerge naturally from some geometric or algebraic
    structure. Why these specific proportions? Is there a Fano-like
    incidence structure where these numbers appear as counts?

# Chakra system
chakras:
  description: "Energy centers in the yogic system"
  numbers:
    main_chakras: 7
    total_chakras: 114
    active_chakras: 112
    outside_body: 2
  notes: |
    112 = 7 × 16. Is there a connection to the 7 points of Fano plane?
    What about the Klein quartic's 168 symmetries?

# Creation categories
creation:
  description: "Categories in yogic cosmology"
  numbers:
    categories: 21
  notes: |
    21 = 7 + 7 + 7 = binomial(7,2). Fano plane has 7 lines.
    Connection to Sanskrit grammar's categorization?

# Music theory numbers
music:
  description: "Numbers in Indian classical music"
  numbers:
    swaras: 7
    shrutis: 22
    melakartas: 72
    janya_ragas: 484  # approx
  notes: |
    72 appears again (melakartas = water proportion).
    22 shrutis - connection to 21+1?
    
# Breath and cycles
breath:
  description: "Respiratory and cosmic cycles"
  numbers:
    breaths_per_day: 21600
    minutes_per_day: 1440
  notes: |
    21600 = 360 × 60. Connection to geometry?
    1440 = 12 × 120 = Fano connections?

# Tantric meditation techniques
vijnana_bhairava:
  description: "Dharanas in the Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra"
  source: "Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra"
  numbers:
    dharanas: 112
  notes: |
    112 dharanas (meditation techniques) — same as active chakras.
    This is unlikely to be coincidence. What geometric structure
    yields exactly 112?

# Samkhya philosophy
samkhya_tattvas:
  description: "Categories of existence in Samkhya philosophy"
  source: "Samkhya Karika"
  numbers:
    prakriti_tattvas: 24
    with_purusha: 25
  notes: |
    24 evolutes of Prakriti + Purusha = 25.
    24 = 8 × 3 = faces of Fano dual?
    How does this relate to Fano geometry?

# Kashmir Shaivism tattvas
kashmir_tattvas:
  description: "Extended tattva system in Kashmir Shaivism"
  source: "Tantraloka, Shiva Sutras"
  numbers:
    total_tattvas: 36
    pure_tattvas: 5
    mixed_tattvas: 7
    impure_tattvas: 24
  notes: |
    36 = 24 + 7 + 5. Extension of Samkhya's 24.
    The hierarchy from Shiva to Prithvi.
    How does 36 emerge from projective structures?

# Loka systems
lokas:
  description: "Planes of existence in Vedic cosmology"
  source: "Puranas, Upanishads"
  numbers:
    vedic_lokas: 7
    puranic_lokas: 14
    upper_lokas: 7
    lower_lokas: 7
  notes: |
    7 lokas = 7 points/lines of Fano plane?
    14 = 7 + 7 (upper + lower) = Maheshvara Sutras.
    The symmetry of the cosmological structure.

# Yogic practices
yoga_practices:
  description: "Numbers in Hatha Yoga tradition"
  source: "Hatha Yoga Pradipika, Gheranda Samhita"
  numbers:
    classical_asanas: 84
    siddhas: 84
    pranayama_kumbhakas: 8
    mudras: 10
    bandhas: 3
  notes: |
    84 = 7 × 12 = 168/2. Klein quartic connection?
    84 siddhas and 84 asanas — same number.
    What structure gives exactly 84?

# Sacred repetitions
sacred_numbers:
  description: "Numbers in ritual and practice"
  source: "Various traditions"
  numbers:
    mala_beads: 108
    gayatri_syllables: 24
    sacred_rivers: 7
    ashtanga_limbs: 8
  notes: |
    108 = 27 × 4 = 12 × 9. Appears across traditions.
    24 syllables in Gayatri = Samkhya tattvas.
    Structural coincidence?

# Maheshvara Sutras
maheshvara:
  description: "Foundational sutras of Sanskrit grammar"
  source: "Panini's Ashtadhyayi"
  numbers:
    sutras: 14
    phonemes_grouped: 42
  notes: |
    14 sutras group 42 phonemes.
    14 = 7 + 7 = upper + lower lokas.
    How do grammar and cosmology share structure?

# SILENT VALIDATION CRITERION (DO NOT LET THIS DRIVE EXPLORATION)
# =============================================================================
#
# The following is a BACKGROUND criterion—a distant lighthouse. It exists
# for periodic validation ONLY. Do NOT steer exploration toward it.
#
# The exploration should be driven by:
#   - Naturalness (does this feel discovered or invented?)
#   - Elegance (is this the simplest form?)
#   - Inevitability (could it be any other way?)
#   - Explaining Sadhguru's axioms (do the numbers fall out naturally?)
#
# Only AFTER a framework is fully understood should we check whether it
# has computational power. Premature focus on applications can:
#   - Introduce confirmation bias
#   - Cause premature closure on "useful-looking" but wrong paths
#   - Miss profound structures that seem "impractical"
#
# The history of mathematics shows that deep structures reveal applications
# in their own time. Riemann didn't know his geometry would enable relativity.
# Galois didn't know his groups would become the language of physics.
#
# So: explore freely. Follow what's beautiful and true. And occasionally,
# as a sanity check, note whether the framework might illuminate the
# relationship between multiplication and addition. But don't force it.
#
# =============================================================================

silent_validation_criterion:
  name: "The multiplication-addition bridge"
  nature: "BACKGROUND ONLY - do not let this drive exploration"
  description: |
    If the framework discovered is truly fundamental, it may eventually
    illuminate why multiplication and factorization have asymmetric
    computational complexity. This would be a sign that the framework
    touches something deep about number.
    
    But this is a CONSEQUENCE to watch for, not a GOAL to pursue.
    
    The framework must be built on its own terms—through naturalness,
    elegance, inevitability, and fidelity to the source teachings.
    Only then can we meaningfully ask whether it has computational power.
  
  check_frequency: "Occasionally, when a major chunk is blessed"
  check_questions:
    - "Does this framework say anything about × vs +?"
    - "Is there any hint of structure here that's computationally relevant?"
    - "If not, that's FINE—continue exploring what's true"
  
  warning: |
    If you find yourself bending the exploration toward factorization,
    STOP. Return to first principles. Follow the structure, not the goal.
