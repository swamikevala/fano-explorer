# Seed Aphorisms
# These guide exploration with three types of entries:
#
# TYPES:
#   - axiom: Assumed true facts - system takes as given, won't re-derive
#   - conjecture: Ideas to explore and verify (default)
#   - question: Specific questions to answer
#
# PRIORITY (1-10 scale, higher = explored first):
#   - priority: 10 (highest) to 1 (lowest), default: 5
#   - Or use: "high" (=8), "medium" (=5), "low" (=2)
#
# Format:
#   - text: The aphorism/question text
#     type: axiom/conjecture/question  # Default: conjecture
#     priority: 1-10 or high/medium/low  # Default: 5
#     tags: [domain1, domain2]  # Helps with categorization
#     confidence: high/medium/low  # For conjectures only
#     source: Where this idea came from (optional)
#     notes: Additional context (optional)
