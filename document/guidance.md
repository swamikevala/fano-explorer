# Document Guidance

This file provides direction for how the document should be written.
Edit this freely - the documenter will use this as context when making decisions.

## Starting Point

The triangle with labelled vertices is the basis for the entire exploration. Everything comes from this. From this we get the edges and center, and via XOR arithmetic we get the Fano plane. From this everthing else springs

## Key Aspects

- The importance of symmetry breaking - choosing a distinguished point or line generates the additional structure
- The dimensional movement between projective and affine geometry

## Key Themes

- The geometry is primary; numbers emerge from structure
- Connections between mathematical structures and yogic/consciousness frameworks
- The 112 chakras as anti-incidences in the Fano plane
- Beauty and inevitability of the mathematics

## Tone

- Precise but not dry
- Explanatory, guiding the reader through concepts. Not assuming any prior knowledge
- Let the mathematics speak for itself
- Avoid overclaiming - present connections, let readers draw conclusions

## Structure Preferences

- Build foundations before profound insights
- Define terms before using them
- Each section should flow naturally to the next

## Notes

(Add any other guidance here)
